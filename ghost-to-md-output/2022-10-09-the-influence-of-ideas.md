Some cultures are influenced by long-lived ideas. I’ll demonstrate.

This should be totally incomprehensible, unless you’re part of a specific culture:

Some readers will recognize this and can explain what the idea means. 

For those who can’t, you’re at a *[loss](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss).* Like an inside joke among friends, some ideas are only exclusive to specific people. The readers who don’t get my joke may decide to seek out its meaning to be part of the culture (I’m guessing some of you already did that by clicking the link).

Not every idea can influence human action. In most cases, ideas are just passing thoughts from our minds. Long-lived ideas are the ones that are acted upon, noticed, and replicated many times over. All this to say, I invite you to drop your email below to get future ideas from me and keep in touch.

P.S. I hate using the word 'newsletters' because it has 'news' in it (which I don't typically write about). Drop your email to receive my futureletters...
