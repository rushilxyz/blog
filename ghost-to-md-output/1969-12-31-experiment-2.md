Experiments give us the chance to know more information than we previously had. 

The best experiments are ones with uncertainty. A side effect of unertainty is finding out if something is an investment or a [sunk cost](__GHOST_URL__/blog/avoid-sunk-costs/). We'll never know whether today's experiment will be tomorrow's failure unless we test it. Experiments are to do things for the sake of doing it, finding out what works, and avoiding what doesn't. If you view moments in life as experiments––any result is a good result.
