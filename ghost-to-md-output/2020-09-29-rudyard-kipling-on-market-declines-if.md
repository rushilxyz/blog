Referenced from the [2017 Berkshire Shareholders Letter](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2017ltr.pdf), written by [B-man](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=warren+buffett&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8) himself:

***"When major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:"***

> *“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .*
> *If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .*
> *If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .*
> *If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you . . .*
> *Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”*

Berkshire’s net worth gain during 2017 was $65.3 billion.

> ***"We don't have to be smarter than the rest; we have to be more disciplined than the rest."***

> -- Warren Buffett

Avoiding stupidity is a lot easier than seeking brilliance. Good investors set-up their portfolios for survival, not returns. That's why you don't see them fearing declines. While everyone else goes crazy, they choose to do the average thing. They wait.
