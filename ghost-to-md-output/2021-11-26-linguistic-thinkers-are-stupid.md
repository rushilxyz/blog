It's like a project manager without a nuanced understanding of software. Their skills are sending emails and scheduling meetings. The developer is the one that ends up building the project through technical know-how.

 To think linguistically means to have no idea how anything actually works. You're intellectually or creatively incapable of doing the thing you claim to know. The one thing you *are* capable of is bullshitting without accountability. There needs to be technical knowledge, with a linguistic approach. Otherwise, you'd end up as someone who thinks that scheduling meetings are a skill.
