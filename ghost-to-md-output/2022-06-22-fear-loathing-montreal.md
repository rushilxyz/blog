The racers were ready at dawn. Fine sunrise over the island. Very tense. But the race didn't start until two, so I had a few hours to kill before then. No sleep was had, but I felt hyper-tense from the night before. Memories of this night are extremely hazy. All I have are a couple videos of me. One I took in the men's washroom. The other, getting kicked out of a spa that gives happy endings. Here is one:

The Saturday started as any other when you're out travelling with friends: Roaming downtown drunk looking for a place to eat. The city was crowded more than usual. It was filled with fans ready to see fast Formula 1 cars zoom for tomorrow. I split from my fellow travelers knowing they wanted to wait in line at dawn to see the race. You see, they were true F1 fans. People willing to wait in line at 5am, trying to hustle their way into $600 bleacher seats. I was merely there for the vibes. 

"I don't know about you guys," I told my two friends, "but I'm on vacation mode ready to catch the clubs." "No dice," one said, "But as your friend I advise you come with us. You're on the aggressive alcoholic mode again." I decided to not catch the bait and argue. What he said would just end up being true. Without saying another word, I walk away. There I was, ready to witness what a prime Montreal night had to offer me. Clueless but curious.

I tried to not be my usual aggressive drunk self, fearing that I have no one to look after me. Cocktails are the perfect thing during a Montreal F1 moment. In this city they love a drunk. Fresh meat. I lean on the table and give the bartender in front of me a big smile. "I'll take your favorite cocktail," I say. "After that, I'll take your second favorite cocktail, followed by your third." 

The bartender's name was Tony and by the way he worked, you can tell he admired his craft. When you usually ask a bartender to make their favorite drink, they'll make you a simple cocktail. Something they don't have to work so hard on. Not Tony. He came through. There I sat at the bar, drunkenly writing notes to remember when I'm sober. Here's one:

> "My new bartender friend offered to take a free shot with me. At this point, I'm in some French bar drinking cocktails that I can't taste because I'm too drunk (sorry Tony). I have total loss of basic motor skills, blurred vision, and no balance. My brain continues to function more or less normally. I can actually watch myself behaving in this terrible way, but can't control it. Things will get worse if I continue."

Immediately after writing that, I pay my tab and exit the bar. A few moments later, I find myself walking in front of a strange spa. At first glance, the place looks normal. What got me curious were the five guys waiting outside it. "Why would anyone be waiting in line for a spa at 3am?" I ask one of them. "Well we're waiting to get a massage," one guy says with a fat grin on his bald face. "This place leaves you feeling amazing," he looks at me while doing a familiar hand gesture.

Naturally, I decide to wait alongside him, striking conversations to gather more details. "How does that work? I ask. The guy seemed too eager to answer. He was a man in his mid 30s. Pathetic looking fellow. I wondered why he was confessing to a stranger about doing some shady stuff. Did he think I was too drunk to remember? Truth is, he was merely bragging. Yet I thought nothing of it since he offered me his place in line. I walk in, ready to see some action, but got kicked out for asking too many questions. 

There were no happy endings that night.
