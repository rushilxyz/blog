Although I discussed the [problem blockchains solve](__GHOST_URL__/the-problem-blockchain-solves) a few months ago, I never really explained how it works. This is a good time to do so since DeFi is a pioneer use case for Blockchain (after Bitcoin). 

Blockchain is a decentralized database. We know what [decentralized](__GHOST_URL__/defining-defi) means from last week's [newsletter](https://us10.campaign-archive.com/?e=[UNIQID]&amp;u=13d6f824588a2db77eb01adbf&amp;id=ccb05c9a2e):

- *"How many computers are in the system*
- *The number of organizations or individuals that control the system*
- *If the computers, organization, and users were reduced by 50%— would the system still be able to function?"*

If the above criteria is met in a multiple (consensus) manner—away from single (centralized) methods, the system is decentralized.

**Blockchain Explained:**

[Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/#what-is-a-blockchain) is a public database updated and shared across multiple computers in a network. Like the name suggests, it’s made up of “blocks” and “chains”:

We have block...We have chain...uhh...blockchain

Data is stored and verified in sequences known as “blocks”. Each successful transaction adds a block to the “chain”, which is a cryptographic reference to previous legit transactions.

You cannot transact data unless it’s successfully stored in a block and added to the chain. Altering a block’s data would require changing all subsequent blocks in the chain. For that to happen, you’d need a majority consensus of the entire network.

This is why it’s difficult to hack something like Bitcoin. You’d have to control a minimum of 50% of the nodes before even attempting to alter Bitcoin’s code. That’s the type of security blockchain promises. A database built on trust and consensus rather than central control. 

As for technical aspects of blockchain, I have no clue. Hopefully we get a clear picture after seeing more blockchain applications. I'll continue breaking it down next week.
