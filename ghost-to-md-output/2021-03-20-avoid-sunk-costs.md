A sunk cost is sticking with something bound to fail.

The blood, sweat, and tears poured into a project make it harder to step away from it. It's like a captain sinking with their ship. They’re too invested in it and that investment–the one that makes you sink–is a sunk cost.

Avoid sunk costs at all costs.
