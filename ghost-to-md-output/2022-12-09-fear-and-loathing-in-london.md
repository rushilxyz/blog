As I sit with a wine bottle on a Friday night in London, I ask myself what the purpose of buying this was. When I break down the bottle purchase, I notice alcoholistic behaviour. There was zero need for me to buy this. Yet here I am sipping wine purchased from a Tesco in London. Fuck it, the first step to AA is to admit addiction. I guess I’m 1/12th of the way there. Good enough, let’s take a shot to celebrate.

The second step to AA is to believe there’s a power in you to get over alcoholism. Sure, of course I believe that. Let’s toast to that with some champagne.

Third step is to turn our will and lives to God as we understand “him”. I don’t understand god, not that I don’t believe in him/her/them/it/whatever. Guess I fail this step. No worries, we can always drink our sorrows away.

Reading through the rest of the list got me bored. More wine to keep me entertained. I’ll just stick to drinking till my liver gives in. Seems easier that way.

Mazel tov to you and Kanye,
