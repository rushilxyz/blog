- Knowledge is the furthest truth we have, in an endless pool of guesses
- Guesses become knowledge when conflicting ideas win and have yet to be disproved
- Experiments are needed to find new guesses to go against today's knowledge
- Cultures evolve from a collection of such experiments, which eventually turn into mainstream knowledge

> Is knowledge the truth?
> What assurance do you have?
> If not for guesses.
