I'll now use Charlie Munger as a scapegoat on where my net-worth currently lies.

**Warning:** it's the smartest or dumbest decision based on your views (Munger wouldn't approve).

My investments:

- 30% cash

- 48% bitcoin

- 31% tech ETFs (currenly struggling)

- 1% defi tokens

That's it. A sad sight if you're against Bitcoin. Happy if you're for it. 

My thought process:

- I believe Bitcoin is the best inflation hedge

- The cash is my bitcoin hedge (in case I'm wrong)

- The ETF's are my cash hedge

- The DeFi tokens are just for fun

I've found investments safe enough to not diversity. Truth is, I think diversifying is overrated.

When Warren Buffett lectures at business schools, he says:

> *“I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it so that you had 20 punches—representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all. *
> 
> *Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did and you’d be forced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so much better.”*

I've had months of checking why Bitcoin is a terrible investment. I've found more good than bad––so I'm loading up (even if my main men Munger and Buffett would disapprove).
