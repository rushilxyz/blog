> “We make constant use of formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.” — Friedrich Hayek

Ideas are information stored in a person’s brain. The ideas created, shared, and consumed by us affect our behaviour. With enough criticism to an idea, we can reach a true solution, which has yet to be disproved. Otherwise known as knowledge. People are capable of creating knowledge through experiments and solving problems. We support ourselves in our environment by applying the knowledge we create. Otherwise known as technology:

> “Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale.”––[Software Is Eating The World](https://www.aberdeeninvestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Why-Software-Is-Eating-The-World-8-20-111.pdf)

Like knowledge, technology is its own flywheel. It can be used to bring existence to newer technologies, which solve existing problems to uncover new issues, which in turn, bring newer technologies....and so on.

We’re a decade into delivering online services at a global scale. Physical products have integrated with software for distribution. The internet––which was just a collection of open-sourced network protocols––has become the foundation of the civilization we’ve built. It took 3 decades worth of experiments to get to this point.

We'll discuss experiments for the upcoming decade in my newsletters. Subscribe :)

p.s I've been getting into haikus lately and will use them as sign-offs starting now:

> *Yet to understand,*
> *We must overestimate,*
> *How little we know.*
