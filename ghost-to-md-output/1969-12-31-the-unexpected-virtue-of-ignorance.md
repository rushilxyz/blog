In his paper, *[Science: Conjectures and Refutations](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/gilberto/cursos/cst-311/popper_conjectures_refutations.pdf)*, Karl Popper lays out the foundation for what makes a good explanation. Otherwise known as epistemology, the theory of knowledge:

> *"A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice."*

It's Popper's criterion that for an explanation to be scientific, it must be testable, refutable, or falsifiable. Knowledge is to draw distinction between explanations that are true and hard to vary, and all other statements–whether religious or supernatural. Falsifying an idea creates new theories that combine, rearrange, and add to existing ideas. Testability of a theory is how to determine whether it's false, improving it by virtue of seeking what's true.

For example, the theory of relativity is falsifiable, meaning it's open for criticism. Einstein's explanation was an extension of Newtonian physics, which assumed physical particles can be measured with precision. Quantum theory came along to disprove this conjecture. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle suggested that subatomic particles cannot be measured with absolute certainty, because the particles behave in random patterns that are nondeterministic. The act of measuring quantum particles (smallest possible physical unit change) can lead to diverse movement, improbable to prediction. This does not mean that relativity is false. Although the law of relativity is fundamental to physics, it is not the furthest truth to explain the universe. Quantum theory has proven to be more rigorous of a truth since its an extension of relativity, while creating an explanation that can be falsified further. In 1933, [Heisenberg won the Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1932/ceremony-speech/) for his explanation on quantum mechanics, nominated by Einstein himself*.*

Now that we've discussed some uncontroversial theories of knowledge, we're better able to critique the arguments outlined throughout the rest of this essay. Using Popper's criterion of knowledge, this essay aims to explain misconceptions in science, often used as means of justification, rather than error correction. 

The author, Will Tuttle has an interesting, but misconceived critique of science in his book "The World Peace Diet." The premise of the book argues that herding culture, which are systems that dominate animal agriculture, is ingrained in human evolution. This culture has caused humans to mistreat animals as commodities rather than sentient beings. Of course, disproving Tuttle's conjecture of herding culture is beyond the scope of this essay. I'd like to highlight Chapter 9 of his book "Reductionist Science And Religion." Tuttle justifies that science reduces living beings to their physical parts, while ignoring their inherent values, hence the name "reductionist": 

> "On a deeper level, reductionist science enslaves us by legitimizing only knowledge that is based on logical positivism and a fundamental disconnection between the self and the world. Though there are a few science popularizers who appear to the public to be more progressive, holistic, and even spiritual, these people are typically rejected by the vast scientific enterprise that is founded on the principles of division, reduction, and analysis it inherited wholesale from its parent, the herding culture."

Tuttle purports to define science as obtaining verification from empirical experiences (logical positivism). He further claims that there is an authoritative source to knowledge (scientific enterprise), which uses its methods to reject certain ideas, thus resulting in our enslavement. 

Conventional wisdom on science is that theories derive from similar experiences that repeatedly occur under similar circumstances. This is known as empiricism, which was found to be a misconception in science that Popper popularized. Scientific knowledge is about reality, most of which does not come from anyone's experiences. Conjecture, bold predictions, and criticism are where theories derive from. Experience and confirmation should only count when choosing between theories that have already been guessed. Hence the phrase, "learning from experience." The creation of knowledge requires a conflict of ideas, which can only be found through a variation of criticism that are difficult to disprove, but not impossible. Only then it explain more than it was originally designed to.

According to Tuttle, the "scientific enterprise" downplay and stigmatize conjectures from others, while only relying and justifying beliefs based on logical positivism. This is true, but the part that Tuttle fails is where Popper successfully explains. Science is a criterion for reality, meaning it relies on the "progressive, holistic, and even spiritual" conjectures as long as it's our best explanation of an idea, and can also be tested. 

What if the theory is untestable? 

The 1997 movie "Contact" explores the same question. Contact is a science fiction drama based on a novel written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The film does a good job at criticizing both science and religion, by theorizing the existence of God and aliens. There's a scene where astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway argues with religious author Palmer Joss on the existence of God using a scientific principle called Occam's Razor.

> "Occam's Razor is a basic scientific principle and it says: All things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.
> 
> So what's more likely? That an all-powerful, mysterious God created the Universe, and decided not to give any proof of his existence? 
> 
> Or, that He simply doesn't exist at all, and that we created Him, so that we wouldn't have to feel so small and alone?"

Questioning the existence of God and aliens is beyond the scope of this essay. However, it's worth critiquing the explanatory powers of Occam's Razor using Popper's criterion for knowledge.

When it comes to scientific knowledge, explanations must be hard to vary while still accounting for what it's meant for. The complexity of an explanation is irrelevant, as long as each assumption is true and is testable to be proven false. Simple explanations are more likely to escape refutation because they explain ideas vaguely, to a point where assumptions can hardly fail. Knowledge creation involves a problem that continues with assumptions on how to solve it. When one experiment fails, you move on to the next until a satisfactory answer is found. There must be conflict of ideas for problems to arise and solutions found. Simple explanations are usually true because they provide no means of error correction. In the words of Popper, "A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice."

When we combine simple assumptions from Occam's Razor with Popper's scientific criterion, we receive theories that resemble Nick Bostrom's simulation argument. His premise is that as computation matures, humans will be able to simulate the whole universe in computers. Meaning, there's a high probability that all instances of us are already living in virtually simulated worlds. In his paper, Bostrom explains that the simulation argument is not meant to demonstrate that you are in a simulation. Instead, the argument suggests that if it's correct, at leastone of the following is true: 

> "(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation."

Few years after Bostrom's paper was published, he published another paper addressing criticsm/praise for the simulation argument. One question he discusses is whether the simulation-hypothesis is untestable. Bostrom mentions that there are observations someone can experience that would prove their world is simulated. He describes a window pop-up as an example, that alerts users: "YOU ARE LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION. CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION." Truthfully, I found this explanation to be supernatural, almost resembling the empirical misconceptions discussed earlier. It's true that if a digital warning appeared in our world, it proves our universe is simulated. However, can the same not be argued that if God appeared before us, it would prove certain religious beliefs? Despite invoking empirical evidence as proof, Bostrom's simulation theory does meet Popper's criterion. The reason for this is because confirming evidence for simulation theory would be the result of a risky prediction, which Popper explains:

> "Confirming evidence should not count *except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; *and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory, (I now speak in such cases of 'corroborating evidence',)"

The title for this essay, "The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance" was inspired by the film "Birdman." It was the first movie I watched in preparation for writing this (even if I reviewed Contact instead). Truthfully, I never really cared for the meaning of the title. I just thought it was a cool string of words. I can always give adhoc explanations to confirm the title later on. This was before reading *Science: Conjectures And Refutations *by Karl Popper. The virtue of ignorance isn't about what we know or don't know, but how we can come to know. This is what Popper explains through his "criterion for scientific status."

The purpose of this essay was toshow deep connections between three explanatory sources. I now realize that it's simple to find connections between ideas if we only look for confirmations. Instead of finding confirming evidences between the assigned readings and films, I analyzed the explanations seeking for refutations. After all, knowlede evolves by making bold guesses that are logically sound, but testable in nature.
