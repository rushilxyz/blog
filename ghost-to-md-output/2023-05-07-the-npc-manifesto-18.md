Good Evening Reader,

My last two weeks have been attempts to move away from the reliance of company clouds. We now have a personal playground on the internet. This [site](https://www.npcmanifesto.xyz) was created from scratch. It's hosted on a private server with encrypted storage pointed to this [domain](https://www.npcmanifesto.xyz/):

We have yet to find a purpose for the site, but it will be a good place to experiment. As you should know, progress can only be made through [conjecture and refutation](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-10/). So far, the server can host my personal contacts rather than having them stored with Apple or Google. The next task will be to enable [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) to send my letters to you without a third party.

I'd like to write an essay about the reasons why I've done this. As usual, you'll be the first to know once it's published.

pura vida,
-rushil
