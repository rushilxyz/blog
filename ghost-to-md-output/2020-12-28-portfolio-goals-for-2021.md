The future outlook isn't clear. That goes without saying.

Keeping this in mind, I'm carrying on with my current strategy for 2021:

- Have half my portfolio in low-risk assets which I plan to hold for a 5-year window (index funds, ETFs, and value stocks).

- Balance the other half into risky positions, which I'll sell within the year or so (growth stocks, SPACs, or private equities I can get my hands on).

I'm a Libra, so this strategy feels right. 

**Portfolio Goals For 2021**

The main goal is simple: **I want investments that are ****worth more than I'm paying for.**

> **The long-term goal is to compound my low-risk assets.**

Difficult but doable - if I remain patient and don't interrupt unnecessarily.

> **The short-term aim is to gain non-linear returns from risky bets.**

Difficult but doable - if I can widen my circle of competence.

The overall plan, and perhaps the most difficult - is to:

> **Make my portfolio antifragile**.

For those who don't know the concept of antifragility, picture a hydra:

The hydra gets stronger the more heads are chopped off. That's antifragile. Something that thrives from disorder.

Having a portfolio that grows when exposed to volatility, randomness, risk, and uncertainty - is what I want to build in 2021.

It won't be easy, but it never is. Anyone who thinks it's easy - is stupid.
