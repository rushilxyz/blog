> Reader, I thank you.

Hello dear reader,

I've been [influenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_from_Underground) to change the tone of my writing. If you're new here, the newsletters have become an experiment that I'm most proud of. For that, I thank you. Your generosity of reading and sharing has grown this to a collective of hundreds. We don't communicate much, but I've enjoyed your company so far.

In a couple of weeks, I will be taking on a data engineer role for Cognizant. It'll keep me busy gaining skills in cloud data structures, while I continue my research with decentralized experiments. This newsletter will report back on projects that I pick up on. Warning: I'm becoming more deliberate with ideas that I send from now on. 

This is not to say, that I'll be sharing quality content consistently.

You'll be reading pieces of my intrusive thoughts instead. For now, there's nothing exciting in my life, aside from a large audience that I like sharing with. I plan to earn money and skills while working a challenging job for the next 4 months. Within that time, I want to create a project of my own. I don't know what that is yet, but since you've stuck with me so far, you'll be the first to hear about its blueprints.

For now, consider this newsletter an open invitation to unsubscribe from the emails.

> Again dear reader,
> I thank you for being so, 
> We shall form a collective.
