Stillness fills the air in this town. It was a week to remember, even if half of it was spent with booze in hand. Three or four days of alcohol, no sleep, and sun burned down my adrenaline reserves. Only to be shot back up, as I witnessed a Rolling Loud festival at peak. A giddy sort of high without drugs is the aftermath of this event. It usually signals a crash is coming. But when? Probably best not to ask questions. Ride this high until the inevitable happens.

Tension is part of such feelings. The risk of mental and physical collapse is high, but that’s where the excitement exists. No matter what, collapse is out of the question. It’s an excuse of submission to not make most of this trip. It's a moment of truth, that fine and fateful line between control and disaster. A thin line unknown to me when intoxicated (unfortunately).

At some point I figured I was beyond help, sitting there with a stomach full of fourlokos, in a children's playground, totally incapable of reason. We’ll move on from this. No matter how self aware you are, being drunk wrenches at your insides precisely because it makes you battle with your very self.

A reoccurring theme in this city was one of status. In Miami, a local can easily sniff out the typical tourist. There’s a hint of distaste, one of avoidance. Whether my thoughts are rational or not are beyond me. It might be a projection of where I stand in the social hierarchy. You see, status is a subconscious idea that I chase without understanding the true context of why. Many of my peers (including you) fall in this category, but this could be another irrational projection from me.

Influence is the ability to have an effect on someone or ourselves through certain actions. Status is us placing ourselves "above" others in hopes of influencing people "below" us. This is wrong. Influence is considering everyone equal, yet having the persuasive ability to have them act in our favour. Witnessing the Miami crowd at a specific Rolling Loud performance gave me this foresight.
