This was a poem [Rockefeller would recite](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/lazy-work-good-work/) when asked about his silence during meetings.

John D. Rockefeller was the Jeff Bezos of the 1800s. One of the richest men in modern history. He was also introverted and spent his time in solitude.

A refinery worker who used to work for Rockefeller once said: 

> *“He lets everybody else talk, while he sits back and says nothing. But he seems to remember everything, and when he does begin he puts everything in its proper place.”*
