The purpose of ChatGPT is to figure out how to continue a piece of text it's been given. It learns directly from whatever example of text it reads. Anyone with a computer has access to out-of-the-box Artificial Intelligence. Plug and use a calculator for text. This was thought to be "nowhere near solved" two years ago:

Consciousness is a beautiful idea. One that people have no good way of explaining yet. Until that problem is solved, the path to human-level general intelligence is unreachable. 

Nevertheless my friend, disruption is inevitable. 

OpenAI announced a soft opening of GPT4 this week. Why is it special? Their [white paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) explains:

> "One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans."

OpenAI may have achieved the "interpreting work of art" stage for AI. We have yet to feed it with obscure enough memes than this:

I see disruption in academia as most obvious because of what the (Large Language Model) LLM is trained with..."GPT performance on academic and professional exams:"

Notice the big gaps? Another example of its capability:

Even if GPT4 goes mainstream, legacy institutions will fail to recognize it until it's too late. Certain incentives may cause LLMs to feed itself into every industry. The outcome of this is harder to predict, but let's guess where academia will be:

- Many (definitely some) students will actively use GPT4 as a calculator to pass their courses/assignments/tests
- University/Colleges will look for ways to regulate LLM usage and mark it as forbidden in most cases

That's my expectation on how professors and alumni may behave. On the other hand, if academia embraces LLMs early, people will be tested on their abilities to create, as opposed to programmable thought.
