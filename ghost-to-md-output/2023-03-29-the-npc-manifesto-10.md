Good Evening reader,

In his paper, *[Science: Conjectures and Refutations](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/gilberto/cursos/cst-311/popper_conjectures_refutations.pdf)*, Karl Popper lays out the foundation for what makes a good explanation. Otherwise known as epistemology, the theory of knowledge:

> *"A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice."*

It's Popper's criterion that for an explanation to be scientific, it must be testable, refutable, or falsifiable. Knowledge is to draw distinction between explanations that are true and hard to vary, and all other statements–whether religious or supernatural. Falsifying an idea creates new theories that combine, rearrange, and add to existing ideas. Testability of a theory is how to determine whether it's false, improving it by virtue of seeking what's true.

The theory of relativity is falsifiable, meaning it's open for criticism. Einstein's explanation was an extension of Newtonian physics, which assumed physical particles can be measured with precision. Quantum theory came along to disprove this conjecture. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle suggested that subatomic particles cannot be measured with absolute certainty, because the particles behave in random patterns that are nondeterministic. The act of measuring quantum particles (smallest possible physical unit change) can lead to diverse movement, improbable to prediction. This does not mean that relativity is false. Although the law of relativity is fundamental to physics, it is not the furthest truth to explain the universe. Quantum theory has proven to be more rigorous of a truth since its an extension of relativity, while creating an explanation that can be falsified further. In 1933, [Heisenberg won the Nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1932/ceremony-speech/) for his explanation on quantum mechanics, nominated by Einstein himself:

> *“I am convinced that this theory undoubtedly contains a part of the ultimate truth.”*

My friend, with the boom of artificial intelligence, we must realize that knowledge creation evolves by conjecture and refutation. This is something AI is incapable of today. Creating knowledge is a universal concept known to humans, who are universal constructors. We must ask ourselves whether computer programs will ever go beyond its software–against its creator–to alter its own programming. My conjecture is yes, but GPT4 is far from it, which [explains](__GHOST_URL__/the-npc-manifesto-6/) why it does not impact science.
