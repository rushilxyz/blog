Deflecting is an art and we're all Picasso. Not because we're great at lying, we just don't know the truth ourselves:

The physicist Richard Feynman once said that "*you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.*" It's common to find ourselves in situations where we're in denial. I do it all the time. It's like living in our own bubble, experiencing a world that's different from objective reality. 

The more I think about it, I'm an irrational person. Emotions get the best of me and I try to justify my thoughts by implicitly lying to myself. Everyone else you know–including yourself–is like this. It's not that we lack self-awareness, we just fool ourselves into believing we're rational people. 

I write shit like this to try notice what I'm truly feeling. Being truthful can reveal ways in which we want to grow but haven't. If we can fool ourselves a little less, we can navigate reality much better.
