Good Evening reader,

I don't know what this letter will be about. I have enough liquor in my body to provide ad-hoc explanations to you. It will be in a manner of utmost confidence, which may be incorrect, but I doubt it. You see, there is no way of knowing I am wrong, unless someone proves me otherwise. Conflict is necessary to correct errors in ideas. This is why knowledge continues to evolve. Explanations progress by accurately understanding an idea, while proving its inaccuracy, otherwise known as 'steel man.' 

Most people lack explanations necessary to counter certain ideas. This is but an NPC quality. My dear reader, don't worry, I use 'NPC' unironically. The term describes people who share programmable thought, which you should NOT possess. Think things through. Otherwise, suffer delusion.

Confident writing is something chatGPT can do, I agree, but not bold enough as another person. Especially if drunk. Even if AI can simulate drunk text, it wouldn't be nearly as fun as reading it from a real person. Wine is in my veins as I write this to you. Can GPT do that?

My friend, I urge you to understand the purpose of this manifesto. I refuse to use artificial intelligence to write you such letters. It would go against my very principle as a person. Values are something robots do not possess (unless programmed). It's the fundamental reason the NPC Manifesto is written. To explain values from the nature of reality, using my point of view, encouraging you to steel man. 

pura vida,
-rushil
