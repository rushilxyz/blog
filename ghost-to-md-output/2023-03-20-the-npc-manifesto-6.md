Good Afternoon reader,

There's no voice to my writing. If I'm not careful, people will suspect AI bots wrote this. There's been a breakthrough in the user interface of large language models (LLMs). It scaled the usage and demand for tools like chatGPT, which will lead to inevitable automation of human labour. My question is, what work will be impacted?

The data used to train LLMs are academic metrics for humans, such as exams and research papers. Last week, we talked about why academia will disrupt [big time](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-3/):

> Many (definitely some) students will actively use GPT4 as a calculator to pass their courses/assignments/tests
> 
> University/Colleges will look for ways to regulate LLM usage and mark it as forbidden in most (definitely some) cases

If the regulation of LLMs within universities fail, academia will have to embrace it and major curriculum changes would be in order. People will need to be tested on their abilities to create, as opposed to routine, programmable thought.

Take it a step above education, how will LLMs play out with the labour market? The way I see it, the economy is heading to desperate territory. Businesses are no longer hiring. Soon they will be aggressively trying to automate people out of jobs. 

My friend, can you tell what work will be impacted? I can only guess...

LLMs can be classified as general-purpose technology. Neural nets share universality. Meaning, the system gradually improves to undergo large increase in functionality, spanning multiple domains. This last part is important. GPT might not automate your job, but the data and software built over it might. 

Using this criteria, we can map out few interesting predictions. 

Let's assume the job you do is a bundle of tasks. Each task comes with problems to solve until you are done. For example, university is a series of tasks you do for qualification. Depending on the randomness of a task, certain actions will be exposed to GPTs anticipation models. 

Be sure to not focus your attention on such tasks, those will be the first to go.

Science, critical thinking, and creativity are skills that are less likely to be impacted by current language models. Of course, programming and writing skills are susceptible to the influence of language models. This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) breaks down GPTs potential exposure to the labour market:

Ah my friend, economic ripple are about to form. Whether inflationary from banking or deflationary from technology, best be prepared. At all cost, avoid positions where the exposure will lead to downfall.

pura vida,
