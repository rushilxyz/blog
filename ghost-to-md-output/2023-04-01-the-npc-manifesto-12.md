Good Evening reader,

I understand you may not be a resident of the United States. You must know that I do not reside in America. Yet we must not forget that much of the world trades are priced in US dollars. If the global reserve currency is under threat of devaluation, what makes you think the currency of your country can survive?

Keep in mind, the manifesto is a rule of thumb to seek good explanations instead of a reliance on authority. You must read to become familiar with current uncontroversial knowledge. In my last [letter](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-11/), we discussed the gold standard for money. Let's progress to the petro-dollar scheme that followed after.

World orders are governing systems used by people to deal with each other. It maintains the distribution of military, economic, and social affairs for people within the system. 

Internal orders govern people within countries (rules written in constitutions). A world order refers to countries governing between themselves (rules written in treaties). 

Like the growth of knowledge, internal and world orders typically change after conflict (usually war). This happens when revolutionary armies challenge existing orders to set new rules for their people.

China's current internal order began when the Chinese Communist Party won its civil war in 1949. America's internal order was laid out in their [constitution in 1789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPgE7PNzXag), a few years after the American Revolution. 

The current world order is America. This happened after World War II, when the US emerged as the dominant power. This is also why the US dollar became the reserve currency (most commonly accepted money in the world).

When Nixon ended the [gold standard](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-11/) in 1971, the US allied with oil producers like Saudi Arabia. America guaranteed those countries military protection in exchange for pricing oil in dollars. So began the petro-dollar system. This scheme made it so that any country in the world that wanted to import oil, needed dollars to do so. Voila, the global faith of dollars that was lost in Nixon's default was restored.

Alas, my friend, the petro-dollar system that the world knows today is at risk:

Does this mean a new world order will emerge? I must not overwhelm you with such bold conjecture. The frequency of my writing these short letters are for us to digest such ideas easily, and seek better explanations for them. As always, I welcome any refutation.

pura vida,
