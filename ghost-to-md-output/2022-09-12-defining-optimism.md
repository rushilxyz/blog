The odds of an asteroid hitting Earth is once every 250,000 years. If a one-kilometre rock smashed into our world before the twenty-first century, a lot of us wouldn’t be alive. Yet we live in a time where there’s knowledge on how to defend against such impacts.

There’s an object in space at this moment coming towards us. Nothing to stop it except the knowledge that humanity has acquired throughout the years. The point is that we live in an era of historically unprecedented safety. Just look up. Even if Hollywood convinces you otherwise:

According to the physicist David Deutsch, the principle of optimism is that “all failures are caused by insufficient knowledge” I tend to fail a lot, so writing acquires knowledge to help me detect and eliminate errors. That’s the only reason I spend time typing behind a keyboard.

While optimism involves a stance in future success, it assumes that nearly all failures are yet to come. Being able to explain failure, is how you can detect and eliminate them in the future. The result of not making errors lead to success. In other words, an optimist is someone who can explain failure, not predict success.

The dot-com bubble in the early 2000s reduced household wealth by $6.2 trillion. Amazon peaked in the Internet bubble in late 1999 at around $90/share. Almost two years later, after the crash, you could briefly buy Amazon at $6/share. It wasn't until 2007 that Amazon managed to recover back to its original price. Now, imagine a pessimist. Avoiding what was assumed to be an "inevitable" failure:

Imagine an optimist despite the failure. Yes, there are inevitable bear markets. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be an optimist prepared to explain such failure, while predicting and profitting from the expected success.

FYI–This blog is from an optimist. Take (uneeded) precaution if you're pessimistic. Be warned :)
