Good Afternoon reader,

Bankruns are when people withdraw their bank deposits all at once. In most cases,  banks don't hold enough cash reserves to account for every depositor. There's been a domino effect happening with banks recently, where Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature, and now Credit Suisse are failing.

Will more dominos fall, if so, how far do they go?

This chart shows the Feder Reserve's assets (blue) and liabilities (red):

Notice how thin the margin of equity is? 

This chart reveals the Fed's equity over time, which is the difference between the two lines above:

The Federal Reserve began operating at a loss in [September 2022](https://www.lynalden.com/broke-federal-reserve/). Most assets the Fed hold are long-duration U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. These assets locked in lower fixed interest rates that don't adjust. Meaning, the Fed is  paying more interest on its liabilities than it earns on its assets. 

Take a look at the decades for declining interest rates, inflation, and Federal debt:

Yes my friend, I know economies are a cycle and things like this happen based on the past. Do not make the inductive mistake of predicting based on history. It's better to seek good explanations from the present, by criticizing current trends.

The main question today is whether our money is safe. Banks like SVB were thought to be stable. Even if people's cash are secured by big banks, is the value of money getting eaten away? What happens if the Fed fails its war with inflation? Will there be a nation's equivalent to a bank run? How does one withdraw a worthless currency?

pura vida,
