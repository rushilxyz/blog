Good Evening reader,

I'm thinking–with chatgpt–of a timeline for monetary policy starting from [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com). I promise it'll always be me, physically typing every word to you.

- 1944 (After World War II) the United States dollar became the world's primary reserve currency. The US dollar was pegged to the value of gold.
- 1971 There was an end to the gold standard. U.S. President Nixon suspended convertibility of dollars to gold. 
- 2008 Global financial crash caused central banks extreme measures of expanding monetary policies. The era of low interest rates and quantitative easing began. 
- 2020 Covid-19 pandemic caused economic shock from lockdowns. Central banks responded the same as 2008, but on a much larger scale.

Now my friend, we got a timeline to build on without chapgpt: 

Silicon Valley Bank failed last week. It was the largest bank collapse since 2008. The second largest in US history. Those affected by the collapse were regular depositors, tech companies, and their employees. 

Bank runs are the buzz, even if gpt4 stole the spotlight. 

A bank run can be described as a large movie theatre with one door. If the theatre were to catch on fire, and the door locked, people would panic for an exit. I'm wondering about layoffs, inflation, if other banks are solvent enough, and if the central bank is stable? If not, where will the theatre exit? Would gpt4 know? 

pura vida,
-rushil
