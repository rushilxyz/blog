Dopamine is motivation. It's a cycle of ups and downs just like our economy. The higher it goes, the further it falls. Things that increase dopamine levels, can deplete motivation after. That's where depression starts. Let me explain by analogy:

**We’re in a recession:**

- Two consecutive quarters with negative GDP growth
- Substantial rise in unemployment (by 2% or more)

The past 40 years were an era of abundance mainly because of technology, globalization, and stimulus. Economies are a machine made up of short and long term cycles of spending and debt. A recession historically happens every 3-10 years for most nations. The United States just had its longest period without a recession, at just over a decade. Let’s recap the last 3 years:

1. Global pandemic
2. Panic
3. Lockdowns
4. Economic stimulus
5. Inflation
6. War
7. Energy crisis
8. Monetary tightening
9. Recession

The economic machine is in a vicious cycle. People lose jobs, spend less money, and the demand for non-essential items reduce. Low spending is bad for business, meaning more job loss, and less consumer demand…blah blah blah. Depression. Lasting for years, rather than several quarters (which is a recession).

Usually during this time, governments pump the economy by creating new money. This encourages consumer spending by funding infrastructure projects, supply chains, and unemployment benefits. This is no longer an option.

You see, most investment models are based on using decades of historical performance. What does history tell us about this?

> “The cycle of ever greater financial stimulus may have recently culminated (temporarily), after U.S. money supply1 grew approximately 45% between January of 2020 and April 2022. This translates into approximately 31% of the total U.S. Dollars in existence having been “created” within the past 26 months. It should come as no surprise that an unintended consequence of decades of policy aimed at supporting asset and economic growth is inflation. “Inflation” first came in the form of financial asset inflation (i.e. stocks, bonds and private assets), followed by consumer and producer goods (e.g. CPI, PPI), and now, seemingly, everything.”––[INFL Semi-Annual Commentary](https://horizonkinetics.com/app/uploads/INFL_SemiAnnual-Commentary_FINAL.pdf)
