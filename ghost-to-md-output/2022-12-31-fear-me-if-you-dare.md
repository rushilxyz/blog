Reflect on how great your momentum would build if an enemy were on your back. Yes, my friend, it's approaching hard upon the steps you take, death awaits. The years behind you are in its hands.

Time is but a precious commodity on which we are in debt. If you're in 70% of time with yourself, keep that fact in front of your mind and treat that time as what it actually is: precious. For your final 10%, I pray you know that time means nothing to you, for you have come in possession of a happy life and lived to the fullest.

Yes, reckon your goals for this year, but also hold every hour in your grasp. While we postpone our task, life speeds by. Increase the momentum, acknowledge the nobility of living a better life, and await in peace for when death comes knocking.

Thank you, Mina-ba. The time you've given me, won't go to waste. Rest In peace.
