Anxiety is a heightened activation in the sympathetic part of your nervous system. The physical elements are already measured in the human body. It's the mental aspects of anxiety that are hard to put into words. Here's how I define it:

A feeling of anxiousness is not being able to sit well with uncertainty. We play scenarios in our heads to counteract the inability to travel through time predicting the future.

Anxiety is a paradox because we try to rescue our thinkingâ€“with more thinking. It's like living in a reality show where you're the star and the audience at the same time. Being unable to predict how the episode will unfold creates this meta stress. 

How do we go about removing the stress of anxiety? My answer would be to stop watching your own reality TV show. Just star in it.
