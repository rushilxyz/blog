Dopamine is linked closer to [motivation](https://open.spotify.com/episode/42F7z6Z4CB8hJAstRqMCiV?si=9430a3750b2c4433) than it is to pleasure. It's about anticipation for "what's next" rather than satisfaction from "what's happening". The chase instead of the reward.

The question of "what's next?" triggers dopamine release into our system. That injected dope converts into motivation and spent on what satisfies us. An example of this can be seen in my writing. These blogs are throwaways to get into the rhythm of writing my next [essay](__GHOST_URL__/). I get dopamine from the low effort taken to write this, which motivates me into writing something serious. 

Dopamine should be treated like drug money. You've got to rinse it on something legit, before being able to spend it.
