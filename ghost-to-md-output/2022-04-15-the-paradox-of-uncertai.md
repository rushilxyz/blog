People are bad at predicting the future. We under or overestimate things. Much worse, we under or overthink. The irony of seeing where things go; is never knowing where it's headed. Uncertainty like finance, romance, education or parties are unavoidable. With some preparation and a bit of luck, you may end up going beyond your expectations. With all preparation and zero luck, you'll end up below it. Ultimately, optimism and interest are recipes for good outcome. 

Making good assumptions eventually lead to better decisions. Yet we're shit at assuming what's good or bad. That's the uncertainty paradox.
