Good Afternoon,

It's 1:52pm here in Becamex Hotel New City, Vietnam. I sit here trying to catch up on all the work I'm behind on. Remote work is cool, but travelling while working always ends up badly. No work ends up getting done. It's been a week since I've had a proper 8 hour sleep. I'm on the verge of mental and physical collapse. It's not looking good. To summarize my trip so far:

- I work remotely as a developer
- The company I work for does not know I've travelled here
