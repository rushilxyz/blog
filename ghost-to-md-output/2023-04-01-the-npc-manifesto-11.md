Good evening reader,

The manifesto is receiving good reviews, keep it up:

Surely, this manifesto will proceed to unfold, while also welcoming your criticism. I am prepared to write without applause, until we realize the unexpected virtue of ignorance.

With tough financial times, people are in positions where cash is constrained. This is nothing new, but history is worth remembering.

Let's begin with the gold standard:

After World War II (1944), the value of America's dollar was pegged to the value of gold. The paper dollars had no value other than exchanging for gold, which was the real money. This gold standard was entirely dependent on the US government to not overspend. 

Come 1971, the US started spending more than it earned. They did this by printing more dollars than the gold held in banks to trade. As more people replaced their dollars with gold, it became obvious that the central bank ran out of gold. Later that same year, President Richard Nixon made an [announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Xw5tWsOQo) ending the gold standard:

> "The strength of a nation's currency is based on the strength of that nation's economy--and the American economy is by far the strongest in the world. Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to take the action necessary to defend the dollar against the speculators.
> 
> I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States."

My favourite part of his speech:

> "If you are among the overwhelming majority of Americans who buy American-made products in America, your dollar will be worth just as much tomorrow as it is today."

Is it safe to say that Nixon was wrong? If not, how would you explain this chart:

Notice how the more expensive goods and services involve the American government? The affordable goods and services involve private sectors such as the tech industry, which has proven to be deflationary overtime.

My friend, do you see the point that I'm making? If not, that's fine because I don't know either. The very purpose of this manifesto is to share bold guesses that are based on existing knowledge. Only then can we know more than we originally intended. Is that not the unexpected virtue of ignorance?
