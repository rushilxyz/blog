Good Evening,

I've dived enough into epistemology. You see, philosophers interpret the world in various ways, while the point is to change it. Michael Jackson, a practitioner said that "If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then make a change." 

You see, I hesitate when it comes to titles. I've developed frontend and backend custom applications for various enterprise clients. I can claim the superiority of what senior developers in the tech industry know. Yet, I have no aim to build independent digital applications of my own. Â 

The next couple of letters to you will be to gain some tech independence. The steps should be simple enough for you to gain knowledge. I claim to be a data engineer by profession, so why not put that title to use?

Consider this roadmap, a project sprint, away from the cloud:

- [www.rushil.xyz](www.rushil.xyz) is already registered as a web domain
- storage for the domain needs to be created
- SSH key should be created to have the domain encrypted
- Private virtual server in the same city as the SSH encrypted storage
- Attach the storage to the sever
- Point the domain to the server
- Configure the SSH into the root IP address of the server (can now remote into the server)
- Create username to access server
- Format storage
- Make sure the server is secured
- Nice simple website to host the letters I send to you
- Create contacts and host calendars on website
- Backups
- Receive mail from contacts
- Send mail to contacts

The manifesto continues as a development sprint to gain independence from the cloud, the Big Brother of 2020s. With current AI, there's more incentive to operate off the digital grid. These letters to you will continue to outline how.

pura vida,
-rushil
