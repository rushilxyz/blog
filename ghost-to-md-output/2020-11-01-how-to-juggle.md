***"Throwing is more important than catching. If you’re good at throwing, the catching takes care of itself.***

***But if we learn a lesson from jugglers, we realize that the hard part isn’t catching, it’s throwing. Learn to throw, to initiate, to do with care and you’ll need to spend far less time worrying about catching in the first place."***

[-- Seth Godin, Throwing And Catching](https://seths.blog/2018/07/throwingcatching/)

Let's start with what happens when juggling. You grab 3 balls. The first ball is thrown (which is easy) and the second follows (not as well).

By the time you try catching the second ball, you have to lunge for it. This makes you out of position for ball number 3. 

> A focus on catching is trying to control the outcome. That's a dangerous game. Position for process (focus on throwing) rather than manipulate for results (catching).
> 
> Getting better at throwing makes it easier to not drop the ball. After all, if you're good at throwing, the catching takes care of itself.

That's how you juggle.
