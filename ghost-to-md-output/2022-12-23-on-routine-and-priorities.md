I've asked my flight attendant for my 9th glass of wine, writing this 36,000 feet above Earth. "I'm going to need to slow you down, sir. I don't want you to get to that point during this flight," he responds. Sadly, I'm far from reaching "*that point.*" To reassure the flight attendant (and the person sitting next to me), I respond, "No worries, bring it whenever you feel I'm ready." In the meantime, I'll continue to write. 

Footbinding was a Chinese custom from the Song Dynasty (960-1279). It involved binding a young girl's feet to prevent them from growing to their natural size and shape. It was considered a mark of beauty for women and was practiced from all social classes in China. In reality, footbinding was a painful practice that caused serious physical deformities, often leading to disability. It made women dependent on their families, especially the men. Women not only were trapped in their homes, but they were completely reliant on their husbands.

Keep people dormant enough and they'll become dependent, by extension controlled. When I think back on this year, I try notice the footbindings that have kept me docile. I won't list them here, but it's worth thinking about. Knowing the traps are how to unbound from them, by virtue become resilient. One thing's for sure, my flight attendant has cut me off from wine. That's fine, I'll just order from another attendant.

The games afoot (keep that in mind for the new year)
