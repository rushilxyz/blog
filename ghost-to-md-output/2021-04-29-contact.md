If you want to set up a contact page for people to be able to reach out to you, the simplest way is to set up a simple page like this and list the different ways people can reach out to you.

### For example, here's how to reach us!

- [@Ghost](https://twitter.com/ghost) on Twitter
- [@Ghost](https://www.facebook.com/ghost) on Facebook
- [@Ghost](https://instagram.com/ghost) on Instagram

If you prefer to use a contact form, almost all of the great embedded form services work great with Ghost and are easy to set up:
