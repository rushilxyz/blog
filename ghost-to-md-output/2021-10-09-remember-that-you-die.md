I was supposed to go skydiving today, but it didn’t happen. Luck presented itself in the form of clouds instead (what can you do?). My immediate thoughts when waking up this morning were of the Latin phrase ‘*Memento Mori’*:

> “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.”––Marcus Aurelius

It’s a cliche to say that we’re all gonna die so nothing matters. That excuse is cowardly and adds no substance to the quality of life that we choose to live. *Memento Mori* is a phrase to live with gratitude, disguised as a reminder of death. It’s the actions that we take, influenced by our acknowledgments of death.

For the people who don’t get it yet: **do what you want, while you’re still alive**. It’s a simple phrase, but you’d be amazed at how good we are to overcomplicate things. Death is inevitable, but that doesn’t mean life must be.

memento mori,
