Good Morning Reader,

I've published my official manifesto in this website:

# [The NPC Manifesto](https://www.npcmanifesto.xyz/index.html)

---

The website has been created from scratch. It's hosted on a private server with encrypted storage pointed to this [domain](https://www.npcmanifesto.xyz/). The site is independent of any company and is maintained by me using the computer that I write with. [This is how I did it](__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-16/).

This is what I look like:

There is a problem this website is meant to solve.

Machines have learned how to replicate human writing. The text from robots is so good, many humans are fooled into believing machines will replace them. A realistic theory would be robots replacing human roles, rather than human identity. If this is true, then artificial intelligence will make humans adopt new roles more aligned with themselves.

In an age where machines can replicate human text, image, audio, and video; how can people know the idea is from humans, and not machines? That's one problem the [turing test](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238/) was looking to solve.

Before explaining further, it should be known that I am physically typing the letters that you read. The website is proof of written work from a person, not a machine. Only I have access to write on this part of the internet. There is no robot behind this text. It's just me...a chimpanzee probably not typing Hamlet.

This website is my internet solitude, kept separate from social media platforms. I've built it using decentralized protocols while avoiding centralized software. Soon this website will be my only source of contact, encouraging you to [build your own](https://sive.rs/ti).

The NPC Manifesto is a written theory on becoming sovereign. NPC derives from non-player character. It represents people that are considered to be socially programmed. This manifesto is a reminder to limit the methods of those who hold authority over you. A way to do that is through direct criticism of control, looking for means to escape it.

By now you may wonder why write a manifesto? Truthfully, I want to keep a record of my thoughts for anyone curious enough to read them. Hosting the manifesto on my own server, instead of social media, ensures that I embody its purpose. While this site may not attract much attention, it will exist for you, my fellow reader (seeing that you've read this far).

Warning: the website is a sandbox to experiment on. This will mostly involve research in data computation, large language models, cryptography, and investing. Many things will not be true and they will break, but I ask that you be open to such ideas, no matter how fallible they seem.

Now, enough preamble. Let us uncover the mental models of this manifesto as the days [unfold](https://www.npcmanifesto.xyz/todo.html).

pura vida,
