excerpt: Defining Optimism. According to the physicist David Deutsch, the principle of optimism is that “all failures are caused by insufficient knowledge.” What does he mean?

The odds of an asteroid hitting Earth is one in every 250,000 years. If a rock the size of one-kilometre smashed into Earth before the twenty first-century, we wouldn’t exist. Yet we live in a time where there’s knowledge on how to defend against such impacts.

There’s an object in space at this moment coming towards us. Nothing to stop it except technology that people have built throughout the years. We live in an era of historically unprecedented safety. Just look up. Even if Hollywood convinces you otherwise:

According to the physicist David Deutsch, the principle of optimism is that “all failures are caused by insufficient knowledge.” What does he mean?

Optimism involves a stance toward future success, while also assuming failures yet to come. Being able to explain such failure is how you can avoid them in the future. No mistakes result in success. In other words, an optimist is someone who can explain failure, not predict success. That’s also why I write:

We live in pessimistic times. Inflation, recession, job loss, bear markets, energy shortages, wars, economic turmoil, and government incompetence is inevitable. Be warned, this is merely a precautionary principle. 

Pessimism seeks to ward of disaster by avoiding everything not known to be safe. This might sound like a fine solution, but how can you discover things known to be safe? That's a mystery for the pessimistic.

The dot-com bubble in the early 2000s reduced household wealth by $6.2 trillion. Amazon, a multi-gazillion dollar company peaked in late 1999 at around $90/share. Almost two years later, at the crash, you could briefly buy Amazon at $6/share. Imagine the pessimists avoiding that investment:

Yes, failure is inevitable when it comes to optimism. Negativity on the other hand is a choice. Yet, it pays to forecast positivity, no matter how bold the prediction :)
