Good Evening,

If you read my work, it explains my advocacy for innovation like blockchains, machine learning, social media, and software. I despise identities and labels, but I work as a data engineer, which is a fancy term for consultant:

I help businesses automate their work process by building data pipelines. Again, this is a fancy way of saying that I move data from one place to another, extracting insights companies want to see. There are many people who cannot do my job. Then again, there are people who not only do my job, but do it better than me and for less money (if they lack knowledge of negotiation). 

The tech industry has realized the overcompensation of people like me (who are mediocre engineers or middle managers). This is not a bad thing. For one, companies can lay off the slow burners who aren't productive. As for the people who get fired, they can find work to gain better knowledge.

Recent university graduates that start working lose track of who they serve and why. This is because they're desperate to find work and settle when they can. Soon you realize that people at large companies work to serve specific functions. Such people are usually a cog to keep the clock ticking. In this case, the feedback loop of your career is based on what your managers think of your work, rather than actual people. 

A majority of large technology companies are incentivized to avoid rocking the boat. They sacrifice risk to keep sailing their aggregate revenue streams from customers. Once a recession hits, they find themselves sinking like the Titanic. Want to know if the company you work for is one of them? Ask yourself if the type of work being done relates to this:

My dear reader, understand this, and understand it now. Those who will succeed in the tech industry–or life for that matter–will have the ability to solve the following:

> Frustrating puzzles and problems for people who have time for the hard ones. 

The answer is crystal clear to anyone working at a startup–they serve users. The reason I write is to gain knowledge and showcase it to such readers. No longer do I wish to become a mediocre engineer serving the likes of middle management. With that being said, this manifesto is written for anyone curious enough to learn such ideas. Sure, no practical themes have been discussed in this manifesto so far, but that's a problem for another time.

pura vida,
