> **"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one**."

Experimenting in life refers to people "doing different things" We aren't competing on "doing the same things better" 

Everyone is playing their own games, we got to figure things out for ourselves. Playing games is often pushing buttons to see what you can and can't do 

Experimentation is true criticism. Being truthful about our own outcomes lead us to better results 

Experiments are a gateway to uncertainty. Accept the hand you're dealt and decide on the upside risk to take.

A good way of experimenting in life is by trying things randomly, seeing what works, and avoiding what doesn't. Most importantly, it's about truthfully accepting uncertain outcomes.
