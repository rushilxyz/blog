I fear losing my phone every time I drink. It's happened on many occasions, but I end up finding it someway or another. Today was a day I did not. That's tough. Memories of my second night in Vietnam are hazy. The day went by fine (no drinks were involved). Ho Chi Minh city, formerly known as Saigon is a beautiful place. I explored the area and returned to the hotel before heading to a club. Many things happened after, which I wouldn't want to admit let alone explain. We'll skip to me losing my phone. It ran out of battery at the club. My cousin held on to it for the most part. He wanted to leave. I did not. Naturally, I argue on why we should stay. Big mistake. We argued until he got fed up, handed my phone back to me, and left. I don't remember much after that. I know I kept drinking. I remember exiting the building. I don't know or remember if I had my phone during that time. The next thing I can recall is waking up in my hotel. Room 303. The room we booked was 103. Not sure how I got in. I get out of bed only to find my pants are torn. Did I fall somewhere? My knee is wounded and there's blood on the bed I slept on. Not sure how that happened. I go to room 103 and find it empty. My cousin already checked out. He was in the lobby looking for me, almost calling the police. Truth is, I can't recall how I arrived at the hotel in the first place. I remember getting a ride on a motorbike. Not sure who the guy was, didn't pay him either (I still had my cash). Just no phone. I guess that's all I can really recall. 

My loss is a gain.
