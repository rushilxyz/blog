Strangers with the gift of getting to know each other later become friends. They point out qualities about yourself that you'd otherwise miss. It's their acceptance of those quirks that define your friendship. Our definition has yet to unfold as we continue. I've fully grasped your wit and charm, but fail to witness your vulnerability. Maybe that's why they say love is blind. The uncertainty we get, but the choice to continue. You're my muse and an intricate blueprint that I wish to decipher. I'd like to undress your charisma and carry the load of your love in my eyes. Other loads as well, but I digress. These letters of love are from a friend who used to be a stranger. While the privilege of your presence continues, the burden of these letters will live on. To my valentine.

love,

"That was quick, I see you don't last too long," the eager man said. "How was it?" I told the man I got kicked out for making them think I was a narc. "Truth is, I was never gonna go through with it." I say in my drunk cocky tone. He didn't seem to appreciate that much. "Why not?" he asks, switching his eager tone to hostile. I sensed his demeanor and attitude towards me changed suddenly. Yet I decided to poke further. "I'm not pathetic enough to pay for things like this," I tell him with a big smile. This wasn't true. I just wanted to get a reaction out of him. Truth is, I felt to drunk and nervous to get it up, if you know what I mean.
