Good Afternoon reader,

Small banks have lost a third of their market cap within the time we started discussing about [bank runs](__GHOST_URL__/the-npc-manifesto-5/): 

> "A bank run can be described as a large movie theatre with one door. If the theatre were to catch on fire, and the door locked, people would panic for an exit."

My dear friend, are you someone that enters to look at a burning theater, or do you notice the exit? Some depositors have not only noticed insolvency of small banks, they've already left:

People outflowing cash from small banks – as if on fire – has recently burned US banking markets. This will affect shareholders, which the Federal Reserve may not bail out because they have depositors to worry about. To understand the magnitude of why small banks are failing, this chart is a good reason:

Small bank stocks are in trouble. They are falling like dominos as depositors worry about whether banks are solvent. Anyone who tells you otherwise may want to look at how regional banking markets are doing:

Will this domino collapse continue to larger banks? 

I realize that some depositors have already moved their funds to larger banks. You may think that's enough reason to justify the safety of big banks. To that, I say let's trace how the initial dominos fell.

Silicon Valley Bank defaulted because they purchased long-term US bonds during the pandemic. This was back when interest rates were down. To battle inflation of the US dollar, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates around the end of 2022. This caused major unrealized losses for the treasuries that SVB purchased a few years back. Of course, it's only a loss if SVB actually sells its bonds, which they were forced to do because of the bank run. 

Sorry to say, this scenario is not unique to SVB. According to this [paper](https://archive.is/TVf4q#selection-627.836-627.907), 10% of banks have larger unrecognized losses than those at SVB. My friend, for now, we shall continue tracking where the dominos go. I suggest keeping a closer eye on the exit, in case of fire.

pura vida,
