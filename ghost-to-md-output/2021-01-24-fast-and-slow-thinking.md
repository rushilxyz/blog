The mind has 2 systems:

> ***"System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. ***
> 
> ***System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration."***

**System 1 Thinking**

> *Complete this phrase:*
> 
> *     bread and... *
> 
> *(It's instant)*

**System 2 Thinking**

> *Calculate the solution:*
> 
> *     69 x 69 =*
> 
> *(You have to take time to do it)*

We live our day-to-day using system 1.

The more attention we spend to solve a problem (system 2), the better our system 1 thinking becomes.

Push yourself to solve difficult problems. It'll make your judgment efficiently quicker.
