Inflation is a controversial problem that impacts the lives of many people. This paper explains inflation of the world reserve currency, the American dollar. The analysis includes history of how the United States earned global reserve status. It will also unfold a timeline of inflation after the dollar untethered from gold. Sociological points of view must be applied to this research. Therefore, the paper analyzes the hyperinflation of Venezeualla, as a sociological perspective to the United States. Not only does this paper suggest the dollar is inflating, but it argues that America will lose its global reserve status. The explanation will use sociological principles such as Gresham's law, Thiers' law, conflict theory, and functionalist theory to predict the outcome. Due to Covid19 economic lockdowns, central banks around the world have spent more than its earned, which has resulted in currency inflation. **The Federal Reserve bank is especially vulnerable to inflation due to large debt constraints, money supply, and insolvency, which are major reasons why the dollar may lose its reserve status.**

Before discussing inflation happening in the United States, let us review how the American dollar became the global reserve currency. World orders are governing systems used by people to deal with each other. As functionalist theory suggests, global orders maintain the distribution of military, economic, and social affairs for people within the system. Internal orders govern people within countries (rules written in constitutions). A world order refers to countries governing between themselves (rules written in treaties). Internal and world orders typically change after conflict (usually war). This happens when revolutionary armies challenge existing orders to set new rules for their people, which also gives context to conflict theory. For example, China's current internal order began when the Chinese Communist Party won its civil war in 1949. America's internal order was laid out in their constitution in 1789, a few years after the American Revolution. The current world order is America. This happened after World War II, when the US emerged as the dominant power. This is also why the US dollar became the reserve currency (most commonly accepted money in the world).

With background knowledge of world orders explained, this paper will outline the timeline for dollar inflation. After World War II (1944), the value of America's dollar was pegged to the value of gold. The paper dollars had no value other than exchanging for gold, which was the real money. This was called the Bretton Woods system and was entirely dependent on the US government to not overspend. Due to constraints from the Vietnam War in 1971, the US started spending more than it earned. They did this by printing more dollars than the gold held in banks to trade. As more people replaced their dollars with gold, it became obvious that the central bank ran out of gold. Later that same year, President Richard Nixon made an announcement ending the Bretton woods system. This move led to a significant increase in inflation, as the value of the dollar became subject to market forces rather than being tied to a tangible asset:

When Nixon ended the gold standard in 1971, the US allied with oil producers like Saudi Arabia. America guaranteed those countries military protection in exchange for pricing oil in dollars. So began the petro-dollar system. This scheme made it so that any country in the world that wanted to import oil, needed dollars to do so. The global faith of dollars that was lost in Nixon's default was restored. However, according to the U.S bureau of labor statistics, there are long-term implications for inflation after the US dollar broke away from gold:

Now that the paper has established the current global monetary system, it will provide an analysis of how dollar inflation is happening. The focus will be on monetary inflation, which generally refers to the increase in a country’s money supply. In other words, it will not be about consumer prices going up, but analyze the amount of money in the financial system going up. A central bank has similar finances to normal commercial banks. The central bank for the United States is called the Federal Reserve. In September 2022, the Federal Reserve **reported** to have more liabilities than assets [4]. This meant that the central bank of America began operating at a loss due extra spending from Covid19 lockdowns, interest rate constraints, and unrealized gains in treasury bonds. Unlike commercial banks, the federal reserve can continue to run with negative equity and losses. However, the longer it continues, political pressure can increase resulting in tension for the American dollar.

Events such as the hyperinflation in Venezuela can be used as a sociological perspective for the United States. Hyperinflation often happens in developing countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina, and Vietnam. It is incredibly difficult for hyperinflation to happen in developed countries, let alone the United States. For example, Venezuela hyper-inflated in 2010s due to collapse in oil prices, which they heavily relied on for exports. The Venezuelan authoritarian government ended up printing more money to account of its losses, which added pressure to their currency. Hyperinflation is defined as 50% month-over-month inflation, which is difficult to occur but can quickly compound when it does. In order for hyperinflation happen, faith in the currency must be lost, with the country’s inability to provide goods and services, resulting in lack of economic functioning. This is what caused inflation in Venezuela. In the case of the United States, the Federal Reserve printed new money for quantitative easing during the pandemic. Similar to Venezuela, the US central bank issued new money due to economic lockdowns and pressure from Covid19. This resulted in the federal reserve increasing the money supply in the United States. The chart below breaks down the total monetary circulation that occurred during the lockdowns:

Income inequality is a direct response to monetary policy (Wansleben, 2018). As the field of sociology suggests, there must be a distinction between personal troubles and public issues. This paper’s purpose is to recognize the structural bases of economic, political, and social problems of inflation that affect large numbers of people within the governed system. Conflict theory is the main reason why the paper argues that America may lose its reserve currency status. The United States Federal Reserve bank has long held its dominant position in international trade since World War II. This has resulted in partnerships happening in countries such as China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia to break away from the reliance of United States currency. From a conflict theory perspective, loss of reserve status by the US dollar could result in a new reserve currency. According to Gresham’s law, “bad money drives out good money.” This suggests that when two forms of money circulate the economy, people will acquire good money while spending the bad money. Since the US dollar became the global reserve currency, many countries that have experienced hyperinflation would heavily rely on and move their savings to US dollars. This paper suggests that due to quantitative easing measures taken by the federal reserve in 2020, the US is undergoing severe stress for currency inflation.
