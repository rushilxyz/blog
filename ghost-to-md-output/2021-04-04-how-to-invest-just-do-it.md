The best investors don't give investment advice. I'm not a great investor, but I try do the same. 

Truth is, you'll never learn about investing from reading my newsletters (or anything for that matter). You simply learn from trial-and-error. By doing. Don't distract yourself by looking for investing how-to's. They're useless.

The most practical investment advice I can give you:* just do it.*
