Good Morning (or Afternoon?),

As I sit here typing this in a cute coffee shop in South Korea, I ponder why I write. What is the purpose? With over 400 readers grown from word of mouth (btw ty), what should my letters to you be about? I look back on my year of traveling with great fondness, but I would not recommend it as a working model to others. I was lucky to survive at all. It wouldn't be possible without people I've had the privilege of knowing over the years.

The stakes have been high this year. I'm not sure how much I'm willing to confess in writing, but the thing about email is that you will read this, and it will be forgotten in the abyss of your inbox. This is why writing letters are superior to blogs. The public nature of blogs constrains what I can truly write about. It took many blog [posts](__GHOST_URL__/tag/blog/) this year to realize this. For those of you who share an interest in my writing, I'll be sending [letters](mailto:xyzrushil@gmail.com) for the new year. This will limit my paper trail to the "[1,000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)." Now, where do we begin?

To start, let me share some secrets with you. My education is constrained to a high-school diploma as I delay my undergrad degree indefinitely. I've managed to secure a job as a software consultant--for now--who knows with today's tech climate? My job helps pay the bills and keep my mind busy as I attempt to build a career with my current credentials. We'll see how far that takes me. Another constraint is that I have no LinkedIn account. I dislike the popularity contest that comes with work status and networking. Writing online has been my way to counteract not having *500+ LinkedIn Connections*. Sending letters to 421 committed readers has been effective enough (thank you for reading, feel free to [reply](mailto:xyzrushil@gmail.com) whenever). With all of those heavy burdens unfolded to you, we can now get to the fun part:

- It's been one month since I visited Vietnam, now South Korea, and soon London
- I've been working remotely while traveling
- The company I work for is not aware of this
- I use a VPN to map my IP address to Canada, while I attempt to work from South Korea
- The time difference is 14 hours, meaning I work 11pm-7am for my regular 9-5 hours
- No one at work has suspected me so far 
- Many close calls, like losing my phone in Vietnam, blocking access to company accounts ([full story](__GHOST_URL__/blog/lost-and-found/))
- I've delivered the work assigned, despite the volatility of my journey 
- As a result, my sleep and sanity have been sacrificed
- I'm no longer writing this section in the cute coffee shop 
- It's 4pm Canada time. 6am in South Korea. 
- I sit here in the comfort of my [cute friend's home](https://www.instagram.com/yeegun/), no longer drinking caffeine, but drunk on alcohol:

Let's get back to the point of this letter. What is the purpose of writing this? For starters, I write for myself. It's the best way to structure my thoughts into one useful thread. The reason I share it publicly is to create ideas that have influence. You see, I have no LinkedIn and lack certain credentials. Writing to you has been my way of demonstrating the knowledge I've built until now. For that, I thank you for engaging.
