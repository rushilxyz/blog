Good Evening reader,

In a world where text can be autogenerated by machines, why should people read explanations by other people? Better yet, why should anyone spend their days writing? 

There's a theory known as Occam's Razor, which states that out of multiple ideas that explain a problem, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. It argues that ideas with fewer assumptions are more likely to be true than complex ideas. 

When it comes to scientific [knowledge](https://polaris.imag.fr/jean-marc.vincent/index.html/WSM/Popper-Science-Conjectures-and-refutation.pdf), explanations must be hard to vary while still accounting what it was meant for. The complexity of an explanation is irrelevant, as long as each assumption is true and is testable to be proven false: 

> "Some genuinely testable theories, when found to be false, are still upheld by their admirers-for example by introducing ad *hoc *some auxiliary assumption, or by reinterpreting the theory ad *hoc *in such a way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at least lowering, its scientific status.*"*

Simple explanations are more likely to escape refutation because they explain ideas vaguely, to a point where assumptions can hardly fail. The meme below is a simple explanation that AI is just a frontend of statistics, it's not wrong but question your understanding of how GPT works using this:

All knowledge begins with a problem that continues with assumptions on how to solve it. When one experiment fails, you move on to the next until a satisfactory answer is found. There must be conflict of ideas for problems to arise. Simple explanations are usually true because they provide no means of error correction.

My friend, this brings us to the purpose of this letter: *the work one must focus on to not be automated by artificial intelligence. *After what we've discussed so far, I'll leave you with a simple explanation as a tribute to Occam's Razor. 

> If it cannot have genuine problems of its own, while only helping you with yours, it's a tool, not a replacement. To avoid automation, work on creative problems, not predictive.
