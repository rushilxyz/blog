When it comes to investing, there are time tested theories that prove the randomness of a given markets.

In his [1987 letter to shareholders](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1987.html),  Warren Buffet explains how markets react to the overall economy. He demonstrates market prices through the lens of *Mr. Market, *a poor fellow with bi-polar disorder. I like to come back to this during times of financial crisis. It's a good reminder that an investors judgement should be insulated by the emotions of Mr. Market:

> *"Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions, he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him."*

The economy is similar to Mr. Market in the sense that it goes through credit cycles of ups and downs. When economic growth is depressed, central banks reduce interest rates to encourage credit spending. This debt accumulation leads to a booming economy because it let's people spend and borrow capital with ease. Central banks later raise interest rates to discourage credit growth and make sure debts are paid off for things to settle down.

here have been higher levels

The problem is that this level of micromanagement, with an understanding that the core system would always be bailed out if need be, contributed to higher and higher debt levels relative to GDP, both in private and public realms, and lower and lower interest rates.

In a low-debt system, structural deflation for some of the positive reasons, such as technological improvement, would be a good thing. It means your money’s purchasing power grows over time, as higher productivity from technological enhancements lowers the cost of goods or improves their quality, so you get more value for your dollar.

However, in an extraordinarily high-debt system (which requires a lot of central policy intervention in the first place to be able to get up that high), deflation breaks things and results in widespread defaults, because the cost of servicing debts goes up relative to cash flows.

 Unfortunatelu,

separate from the contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace  

*Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful.*
