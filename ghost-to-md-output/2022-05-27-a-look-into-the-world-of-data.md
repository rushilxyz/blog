Ah dear reader,

As I sit here to envision what this newsletter should be, I've come up with a fun reason. I wish to simply treat these as letters I would write to a friend. Consider these ideas that I consume and find interesting enough to share:

The most important essay on finance this decade, “[Why Software Is Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)” has partially come true. Physical products have not only integrated with software, but rely on it for global distribution:

> “With lower start-up costs and a vastly expanded market for online services, the result is a global economy that for the first time will be fully digitally wired — the dream of every cyber-visionary of the early 1990s, finally delivered, a full generation later.” —[Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/author/marc-andreessen/)

10 years after this was published, its ideas have stood the test of time. The internet in the 90s was a major computing cycle, like phones, computers, and social media in the 2000s. We're in a golden era where data is poised to contribute a large part to the global economy (if it hasn't already):

> "Most computing cycles have “golden eras” when the right mix — including new talent, viable infrastructure, and community knowledge — comes together. For example, with mobile computing, the golden era was 2009-11, when companies like Uber, Venmo, Snap, and Instagram were started. Golden eras are when legendary teams are formed, big ideas are hatched, and great products get built."––[Chris Dixon](https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-fund-four/)

I've become far too complacent from prior commitments with work and studies to fully experiment with skills I've earned as a developer. This will now change. The next few issues will be dedicated to experimenting with cloud computing and data. The reportings will summarize my understanding of today's tech world, as I explain it to you. Ideally, I'd like to match such skills to work on golden computing era type of projects:

> “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg…I think the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we’re actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.” —[David Bowie](https://twitter.com/CaliPnL/status/1449195966720929794?s=20&amp;t=6wfi8eobG1PM8VqwmBWPMA) (1999)

You, as a fellow reader of my emails, will get direct access to the experiments I run. Stay tuned.

> Knowledge evolves how?
> It's from criticism, my friend.
> So, I write to you.
