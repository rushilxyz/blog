Good Afternoon,

Back when I lived in Botswana, they made us where khaki uniforms, which I despised. The khakis came with long grey socks that go up to your knees:

I hate uniforms. 

I'm not a fashionable guy, so the fact that I must wear different clothing scares me.

I hate ties and I hate suits. It wasn't until wearing a handmade cashmere coat from South Korea that I realized, uniforms matter. I now understand that the right attire can give you access to so much more.

Don't find yourself lacking the appropriate attire. It could cost you. An example is me walking into a first class lounge. The server simply assumed that I belonged there. Why? Because I dressed the part. Handmade cashmere coat from Korea baby. Not just that, but wearing it made me feel like first class material. If you look the part, you can be it. Fake it till you make it.

I sit here writing this letter at 6:00pm in Abu Dhabi international Airport, first class lounge. It's 9:00am Toronto time. This is when I start work. Yet, I've drank 6 Gin and Tonics, currently sipping on a White Russian. Writing this, free of charge with VIP access because they assume it. In the end, uniforms are all that matter. You'd be surprised by how much you can get away with.

From love in Abu Dhabi,
