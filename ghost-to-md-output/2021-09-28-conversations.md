Talking is easy because small talk is static. It has a structure where words feel automatic or rehearsed. Conversations are dynamic, long, and random. There's no rehearsed answer, just people making it up through improv. That's tough to do because you need to be attentive to improvise. A lot of the time, we listen to our internal dialogue not realizing the other person.

Two things that break a conversation: our inability to listen and engage. Anyone can hear someone talk, but to comprehend and equally exchange is the tough part. Two people doing that with ease is called chemistry. Many conversations over time is how you get chemistry. Once you do, those people remain in your life til time.
