Wallstreetbets took Gamestop to the moon and bullied hedge funds along the way. Despite making millions, many buyers refused to sell.

> *"I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend).*
> 
> *And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you."*

Hedge funds are the apex predators on Wallstreet. The top 1% or as the Wolf of Wall Street would say:

Their bet against Gamestop created a trade mob, which took the other side of the bet. Just when redditors grabbed billionaires by the balls, Robinhood shuts down the buy-side of the trade. It gave hedge funds time to regroup, reposition, and save themselves.

**Defining Decentralization And Oligarchy**

Decentralization is made up of 3 parts:

- How many computers are in the system

- The number of organizations or individuals that control the system

- If the computers, organization, and users were to reduce by 50% -- would the system still be able to function?

Oligarchy is much easier to define. It's a small group of people who control the system. Central intervention wether it's a country, organization, or institution.

For example, Robinhood cock-blocking GME trades.

The **In**novation section has been dedicated to Bitcoin since [October](https://mailchi.mp/rushil2cents.com/your-5-ins-bitcoin-rockefellers-fav-poem-low-interest-rates-low-returns-higher-risk?e=[UNIQID]). I'm no longer continuing since I'm done buying bitcoin (it’s now a third of my portfolio). I’ll be exploring something new in the coming months instead.

Consider this an introduction to DeFi: 

**The Demand For Decentralized Finance**

I've become bullish on DeFi systems after seeing Twitter banning Trump, Whatsapp reading messages, Discord censoring r/wallstreetbets, and Robinhood catering to hedge funds.

To summarize the concept in a sentence:

> *"It’s easier to build a new financial system than it is to reform the existing one."*
> 
> *DeFi is an attempt to build that new system without central financial institutions.*

We've discussed naive intervention leading to harmful, unintended side-effets. Those side-effects will lead to increased demand for DeFi. Exploring the demand is my way of being a step ahead of hindsight. 

We'll become DeFi experts within the coming months together. Hopefully finding asymmetric bets along the way.
