For context: I have (had) a [newsletter](__GHOST_URL__/rushil2cents-newsletter) where I sent **In**-sight on **In**-vesting and **In**-novation from **In**-ternet to **In**-box. The name: [5 In's Newsletter](__GHOST_URL__/newsletters). As of this week, I've ended this structure. The rest of the very last 5 In's newsletter:

Hey Pal, 

This is the 36th and final 5 In's Newsletter.

As of next week, I'll be brainstorming new topics to write about––without following a structure. I've become bored of the repetition and I have a feeling you are too.

The new series will come with a new name and new ambitions.

Until now, this has been a really fun side project and I’m grateful to every pal who's subscribed. I set a goal to get 500 subscribers within a year. We're on 253 now, well on our way:

I've realized the newsletter is for me to communicate with smart, curious, passionate people around the world every week.

The 5 In's structure was a crutch to deliver a newsletter without fail. It's now become too predictable and I prefer the uncertainty of not knowing what to write about. 

That means I’ll be experimenting with new ways of delivering content, starting conversations, and engaging with subscriber pals.

**With that change comes a new goal:**

> **I want to grow this to 500 subscribers by the end of April, and I need your help to get there.**

I get nervous asking people for help. It's why I bury my ask to share these e-mails with your pals at the very bottom. Most of you probably never see it.

Today, I’m putting it front and center:

> **If you enjoy or get value from 5 In's, Please help me get to 500 pals by the end of April by doing any of the following**

- **Forward this e-mail to friends and telling them to subscribe**

- **Share on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook with a short note**

- **Share within your existing community or group chats**

Getting to 500 people shouldn’t be hard. To put it in perspective with 253 of you, we just need to reproduce 0.9763 to get to 500.

My mission remains to: share ideas with people who share the same curiosity as me. Yet, the opportunity has grown much more than that, and I appreciate your support on this wild ride. Thanks pal.

As for your 5 In's (gonna be short and sweet):

**Insights -** Owning Equity Gets You Leverage

Jay-Z is a top-tier Venture Capitalist.

Here's why:
 

![](https://mcusercontent.com/13d6f824588a2db77eb01adbf/images/67befde6-f888-4f5a-8819-a69c0013953b.jpeg)

Spotify didn't want to fork the $1 billion to stream Jay-Z's music. So he simply became the owner of Tidal to leverage the streaming industry.

Jay-Z is now $300 million richer after [Square acquired Tidal](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/tech/square-tidal/index.html) this year.

On top of that, Hov's albums ended up in Spotify anyway (for a large chunk of change no less). 

Speaking of Hip-Hop legends, RIP DMX.

**Investing - **My Main Man Warren's Last 5 In's Lesson

I started these newsletters to "teach" people how to invest. Writing about it a year later has made me realize: it can't be done. It's impossible to show people how you won the lottery.

What I'll be doing now is demystify topics I'm curious about (with hopes that you're like me and would enjoy reading it).

**Innovation -** What You Need To Know To Understand Blockchain

I'm taking a cryptographic securities course this semester. It's made it easier to understand how Bitcoin works (thankfully). 

Here's the bulk of what Bitcoin's technical concepts comes down to:

- Digital signatures
- Hash functions
- Blockchain timestamps
- Nakamoto consensus
- Merkle trees
- Crypto oracles

I'll be breaking these all down in a future post (It's an excuse for me to study for my exams)
