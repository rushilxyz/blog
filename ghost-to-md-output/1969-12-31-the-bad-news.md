**We’re in a recession:**

- Two consecutive quarters with negative GDP growth
- Substantial rise in unemployment (by 2% or more)

The economy is a machine. It’s made up of short and long term cycles of credit and spending. For example, a recession historically happens every 3-10 years for most nations. The United States just had its longest period without a recession at just over a decade. The past 40 years were an era of abundance mainly because of technology, globalization, and stimulus:

Let’s recap the last 3 years to sum up the short-term debt cycle:

1. Global pandemic
2. Panic
3. Lockdowns
4. Economic stimulus with lowered interest rates
5. Inflation
6. Monetary tightening
7. Recession

The economic machine today is in a vicious cycle. People lose jobs, spend less money, and demand for non-essential items reduce. Low spending slows down businesses, meaning more job loss, reducing consumer demand…blah blah blah, you get the point. Recession.

Usually during this time, governments try pump the economy by encouraging consumer spending. To do this, new base money is created to fund infrastructure projects, supply chains, and unemployment benefits. Interest rates are also lowered so people can borrow more money. This is no longer an option.

Most investment models are based on using decades of historical performance. What does history tell us about this:

> “The cycle of ever greater financial stimulus may have recently culminated (temporarily), after U.S. money supply1 grew approximately 45% between January of 2020 and April 2022. This translates into approximately 31% of the total U.S. Dollars in existence having been “created” within the past 26 months. It should come as no surprise that an unintended consequence of decades of policy aimed at supporting asset and economic growth is inflation. “Inflation” first came in the form of financial asset inflation (i.e. stocks, bonds and private assets), followed by consumer and producer goods (e.g. CPI, PPI), and now, seemingly, everything.”––[INFL Semi-Annual Commentary](https://horizonkinetics.com/app/uploads/INFL_SemiAnnual-Commentary_FINAL.pdf)
