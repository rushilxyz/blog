Sméagol became Gollum after his attachment to the One Ring:

He became deformed and twisted by body and mind because of his affection for his precious. Attachments aren't bad, but it's the context that matters. Addiction is our justifications getting louder while priorities become silent. Example:

^It takes one to know one, but that's not the point^

When you notice attachments like Precious from Lord Of The Rings or juuls from YouTube––it's best to avoid it. That doesn't mean you should cut it off entirely. It'd be nice to disappear at times, but only when your priorities outweigh your justification.
