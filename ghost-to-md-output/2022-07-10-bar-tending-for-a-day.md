Unfortunately, my professional career has been tied down to software. I'm no good at things like hammering a nail to a wall. My career will be behind a monitor. I'll be pushing keys in the correct combination for a living. That being said, bar tending is a gig that I got to experience today. 

While the requested drinks were novice, the joy I got from serving them was amazing. Bar tending is tough. It keeps you on high alert always. You can drink on the job, but it's not a job you'd want to drink on (that didn't stop me). 

What I appreciate about bar tending is that the job gets done, regardless of circumstance. You ask a drunk bar tender to serve you a gin and tonic, and they'll fall into the rhythm of pouring gin, adding the ice, tonic, and a smidge of lime. 

In my 4 hours experience of being behind a bar, I can tell you that bar tenders are never complacent. They're subtle. No complaints or a false sense of satisfaction. We are meant to do things that get the job done. Like life in general. Though it can get intimidating, bar tending provides the ability to learn on the job. It's an underrated skill worth picking up on.
