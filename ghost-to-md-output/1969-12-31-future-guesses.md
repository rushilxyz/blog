The internet evolved from a decentralized experiment that let computers communicate with each other. This eventually scaled to let people communicate ideas through computers. From a collection of network protocols, we found a microphone to share our memes:

Using network protocols to publish online content had a learning curve for people to adopt. This was before the second era of the internet took over. Companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple offered services for people to create content in exchange of owning its distribution. 

The most important essay on finance this decade, “[Why Software Is Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)” has partially come true. Software gains competitive advantage because of how the internet scales distribution. What is important thing to note is that there are strong winner-take-all effects that happen. 

The most important essay on finance this decade, “[Why Software Is Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)” has partially come true. Physical products have not only integrated with software, but rely on it for global distribution. 

This means that computers make logical agreements to verify what’s true. As a result, trust in central authority may reduce by virtue of letting computers making the commitments instead.

Decentralization is an extension of what the internet first started out as.

I believe that we're in the middle of a dramatic experiment in which decentralized organizations are poised to contribute a large part to the economy.
