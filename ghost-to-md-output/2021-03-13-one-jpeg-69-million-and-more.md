An artist by the name of [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple/status/1347406074685566977?s=20) has made bank selling Non-Fungible Token [artwork](https://twitter.com/beeple/status/1370595125961887747?s=20). His latest sale:

> “Everydays: The First 5,000 Days.” 

A 21,069 x 21,069 pixels jpg file sold for [$69 million](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924). To be more accurate, it sold for ~37,300 Ethereum.

This is what it looks like (unfortunately, my jpeg is worth $0 and 0 eth):

To put that craziness into perspective:

Ethereum is up [150%](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum) YTD and 750% from last year. Today's $69 million could be worth waaaaaaaaay more money few years from now.

You're probably thinking — $69 million is too much to spend for a JPEG file.

Truth is, Beeple didn't get paid for selling a JPEG. He earned it from 5,000 days of creating – packed into a single piece of art. Work created for its own sake without intention to sell. That’s why he got paid.
