It costs a lot to participate in Decentralized Finance. If you play the DeFi game, you've probably heard of "gas".

Gas is a fee you pay to trigger DeFi code stored on the Ethereum blockchain. It's like a ticket price you pay to enter the carnival. Gas is the ticket for DeFi and it's extremely high.

Ethereum claims that gas keeps the network more secure. They've gone from a "proof-of-work" blockchain to a "proof-of-stake". It's less secure, so gas prevents attackers from spamming the network.

For context, I tried investing $200 in a specific DeFi token. The gas fee alone ended up being ~$40. Pay attention to gas or youâ€™ll pay a high price.
