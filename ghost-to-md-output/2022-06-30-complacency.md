This is the word of the year:

> "a feeling of smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements."

It stems from an opposite feeling I've acquired in 2022. Self-loathing. Defined as doubting oneself.

Despite having the confidence and ego to understand my status in society--even if status is bullshit--I've gotten doubts.

It's funny how questioning yourself can come from being too complacent.

The comfortable feeling and satisfaction we get from the knowledge we have, turns into fear and loathing. All from realization of not criticizing ourselves enough.

> what's complacency?
> if not for stemming self-doubt.
> Criticize comfort.
