The last newsletter was about central bankers creating a wealth divide. This week, a decentralized hedge fund ([r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)) exploited a mistake from multi-billion dollar hedge funds. 

We witnessed a transfer of wealth between rich hedgefund managers to regular retail investors. Making it a historic week for Wall Street, Reddit, GameStop, AMC, Twitter, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin.

Going against my investment ideas, I bought AMC stock to:

- Exploit the mistake
- Join the rebellion
- Take it to the moooon
- Make money along the way (hopefully)

I lost half the money put in.

After a week of questioning what I knew about investing, here's what I've concluded:

It's not about the money...

My Message:

**Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes**

My pal invested (much more than me) in GameStop, AMC, and Dogecoin.

Here's how he justified the risk:

> *"You can only lose 100% of the money you put in"*

After thinking about it more, he’s right. 

> *Benefitting from volatility means to profit more when you’re right -- than it would hurt when you’re wrong.*
> 
> *Going back to the barbell theory, you want favourable asymmetry. When the upside is greater than the downside. More to gain than to lose. *

Granted, I was wrong and lost 50%. But it was an amount I was comfortable losing. You win big (or lose small) with asymmetric bets. And I made back what I lost after Elon pulled this stunt:

My message is to seek favourable asymmetric bets, be fine with losing if you're wrong, and benefit from volatility if you're right.

That's what [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) did with billionaire hedge funds. More on that in the next section.
