When you chalk it up, life is a collection of '*could've beens*'. I *could've* checked in my flight the night before departure, but waited to do it at the airport instead. I *could've* left for the airport early, but arrived 30 minutes before take-off. At this point, it's too late to check in--let alone catch my flight. 

Hindsight is us fantasizing about what *could've* been if we did things differently. My pals have arrived at their destination, while I sit here eating a bagel, writing this blog, and waiting for a connecting flight. The funny thing about *could've beens*, we end up being where we should. Make the best of it I guess.

Veni, Vidi, Vici,
