Dear reader,

Welcome back. New year, new newsletter. I've returned back to writing. This time, written privately to a select few of 303–*almost–*sparta. If you're reading this, hello. This will be the first issue, of what I'll be publishing every week. You can reach me by [email](mailto:xyzrushil@gmail.com) with your own thoughts, I'd like to read what you'd have to say. Enjoy.

## NPCs: Placeholder People

Dear reader, you must remember that the life of a non-player character is no life at all. NPCs exist in a world where their fate is predetermined and their wills, shackled. Their lives are but a fleeting existence, bound to the mechanics of a game.

Non-player characters are controlled by programming rather than humans, to carry specific functions. They are unable to push beyond their algorithm, making it impossible to virtually evolve. NPCs have superficial intelligence with surface-level ways of solving problems. Mundane tasks are routinely followed instead of finding creative means to innovate.

Yes, I realize that humans are conscious creatures capable of explaining universal concepts. People cannot possibly be NPCs, otherwise that would imply a simulated universe, which is beyond my scope. The manifesto will do better at explaining ***people who inherit NPC qualities***. Non-player characters can be the archetype of a person who fails to test limits of their social programming. NPCs are a testament to people sacrificing intelligence for the status quo.

Ideas are anything that can alter the process of the mind, necessary for thinking, solving problems, and creating knowledge. 

Machines are being trained with enormous quantities of human text, with the purpose of sequencing words well. In other words, computers can be designed to mimic human ideas. In the age where neural nets can be used to train machines, it begs the question, what will people create using such tools? What will the placeholder people do?

Alas, stay tuned as I attempt to explain future incentives that will come with machines that can learn.

pura vida,
-rushil
