Many of you don't know what I do for a living. That's fine. Those who do know, fail to explain what it is that I actually do. That's fine as well. If you're a regular reader of this blog, you might guess that I'm (attempting) to make a career change. What does that involve? Truthfully, it's tough thinking about it. 

Let's say you dedicate four years studying for a degree qualifying you for a career. It's the education that you rely on, distinguishing you for the career of your choice. This doesn't account for economic factors in play. Why would a business hire anyone with record high unemployment, inflation, and interest rates? Unless your degree is in demand, what seperates you from the masses? 

I'm not a good writer, but I'm bored enough to break down my past careers. Be warned, there's absolutely no point to this blog (like everything else I tend to write about). I'm merely thinking of how careers evolve and what I can do to change mine:

## Call Centres

Imagine 8 hours of sitting and surveying people on their banking experience. 

Call after call you read the same script saying the same words over and over again. 

"Are you satififed with the branch you visited?", "What would you rate it out of a scale of 10, with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best?" "Would you recommend the banking service to a friend?" 

The job for me was boring. I learned how to do sudoku puzzles while surveying people. It lasted for one summer, yes, but it felt like forever. I recommend trying it if you don't believe me.

## Tutoring Kids To Code

Imagine commuting two hours to teach kids how to code. 

It doesn't sound too bad, but what if you were had to bring 15 laptops in a large suitcase? 

I didn't drive then, but carrying luggage around trasit took a lot of energy. I made less than minimum wage per month. 

To this day, I ask what was the purpose? At least I got to learn javascript while tutoring the children.
