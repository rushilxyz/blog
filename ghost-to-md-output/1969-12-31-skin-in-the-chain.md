> *“When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game but you don’t get a win unless you play in the game” — *[*The Room Where It Happens*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySzEXKUSZw)

If you play a game enough times, you’ll have the scars to prove it. “Skin in the game” is a saying that demonstrates being involved with something to a point of risking one’s reputation. To take risk and be accountable for those actions means you have skin in the game. Let’s look at it from perspective of playing a game like CSGO (the one video game I played a lot):

- Like any other game, CSGO has ranks that establish your skill level
- You compete with people who share the same rank as you
- The more games you play and better you get, the higher you rank
- Players can rank up quicker by competing with higher skilled players

With every internet being one large platform connected through crypto wallets, earning reputation will be like playing a video game. Users would achieve social and financial capital based on what internet communities they’re part of. NFTs will be a key part of credentialing and tracking reputation amongst users. The sooner your on-chain activity begins, the larger your social capital could build.
