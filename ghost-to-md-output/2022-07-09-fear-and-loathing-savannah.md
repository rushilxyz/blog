Family can be close regardless of distance. Although it can get competitive (in terms of status and hierarchy) it doesn't make it less fun to imteract with your aunts, uncles, and cousins. Â 

The heat down in Georgia has a blaring sun that burns your skin. The humidity alone can shield heat and act like a blanket (making Savannah more unbearable). 

Yet whether it's from the friendliness of the city, or from connections through your cousins (aunts and uncles). The nightlife can only be compared to one word. Acidity.

All I can advise is getting lit with family. It surprisingly brings new unforeseen sides, definitely worth the experience.
