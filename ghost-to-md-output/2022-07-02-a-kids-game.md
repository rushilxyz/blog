You can drive sober when you're drunk. Follow the speed limit, listen to songs, enjoy the journey, and stick to your lane. Don't prove that you can drive like Dom Toretto when you're several shots deep. It won't end well.

Status is a deadly game. Yet we're all forced to play it. Choose to be aware or unaware of the fact that what you do in life is for status.

Whether it's building careers, relationships, or wealth, status plays a big role in the life you want to live. Competing is a part of growth. Evolution is fundamentaly natural selection. If you're not strong enough, you cannot progress.

A side-effect to status is the need for flexing hierarchy. Ivy league education, bank accounts, or bottles that you get in a club; these are merely status symbols. Defining youself based on status is a poor way to determine your self-worth. That doesn't mean you shouldn't play the game.

> Become an averge joe.
> Do not compare worth,
