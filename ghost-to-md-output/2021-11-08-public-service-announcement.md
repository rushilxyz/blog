Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is rushil. x to the y z.
![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/11/Rushil-s-2-Cents-3.png)you can tell that's me cuz of my big nose
I write explanations for people curious about things that I’m curious about. Right now, those curiosities lie in [crypto](__GHOST_URL__/) and daily [living](__GHOST_URL__/blog/).

You might ask why write online? I’ll answer with another question: why does anyone do anything? Many of my mutuals have started something for the sake of doing it:

- [Non-profits](https://thebioball.com) for [cancer research](https://thebioball.com/our-story)
- Vlogs on [good food](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBRQghYWgnwfbv8pUgXZq6A) and [summer trips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11JMTQJmjoY)
- Photography [portfolios](https://cyrus.photos/) on [street fashion](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVzaX2mgUNN/) and [sneaker culture](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUeeieQAFV2/)
- Side hustles [marketing](https://www.instagram.com/lilsoyco/reels/) and [selling](https://lilsoy.square.site/) soy candles
- [Discord groups](https://www.powertradeinvesting.com) teaching people about [financial trading](https://www.instagram.com/power__trade/)
- Custom canvas [painting](https://www.instagram.com/paintingsidk/) commissions 
- [Music](https://song.link/cashout) writing, recording, and [streaming](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cXtMPyjj49G5dfZiO7W7Q?si=443qXDieTaSCZ2GO7B7wAw)

- [Content diary](https://www.instagram.com/wendy_sk8er/) showing your rollerblading skills

It’s encouraging to see people experiment based on what they like to do. I've got a career as a cloud developer, but I don't see myself doing it all my life. Experiments like above are how you end up doing things you want. 

> PSA: run experiments, see what works, and avoid what doesn't. You'd be surprised.
