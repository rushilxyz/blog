This started out as an essay about recession, but I found that it’s useless to predict macroeconomics:

> “In the study of such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the actions of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine the outcome of a process…will hardly ever be fully known or measurable.”––[Friedrich A. Hayek](https://mises.org/library/pretense-knowledge)

Let’s detour from modern finance. This essay will focus on having no aim, but finding a way. I know that doesn’t make sense, but there’s a point to this essay, so stick around if you can.

# The Influence Of Ideas

Cultures are influenced by long-lived ideas.

I’ll demonstrate. This should be totally incomprehensible, unless you’re part of a specific culture:

Some readers will recognize this and can explain what the idea means. For those who can’t, you’re at a *[loss](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss).* Like an inside joke among friends, some ideas are exclusive to people from inside the culture. Readers who don’t get my joke will decide to seek out its meaning. I’m guessing some readers already did by clicking the link.

Not every idea can influence human action. In most cases, ideas are just passing thoughts from the mind. Long-lived ideas are the ones that are acted upon, noticed, and replicated many times over. All this to say, exceptional ideas are formed by optimism.

# Optimism Is A Good Idea

The odds of an asteroid hitting Earth is one in every 250,000 years. If a rock the size of one kilometre smashed into Earth–before the twenty-first century–we wouldn’t exist. Yet we live in a time with knowledge on defending against such impacts.

There’s an object in space at this moment coming towards us. Nothing to stop it, except technology that people have built over the years. We live in an era of historically unprecedented safety. Just look up. Even if Hollywood convinces you otherwise:

According to the physicist David Deutsch, the principle of optimism is that “all failures are caused by insufficient knowledge.”

What does that mean?

True optimism is a stance towards future success, while assuming the failures yet to come. Being able to explain failure is how you can avoid them in the future. Making zero mistakes will result in success. In other words, an optimist is someone who can explain failure, not predict success. This is also why I write:

Bad news is good news on a long enough time scale, but only if you can recognize the cause for failure and fix it. True optimism is being open to experimenting so that we can see what works. In the worst case, mistakes are repeated without questioning what’s not working.

# “But I Digress”

One thing I’ve learned as a software developer is that: *Problem-solving let’s you question what you are doing*. Problems give ideas to break patterns, even if wrong, can be usefully wrong by updating us on where to go next.

This brings me to the point of this essay. “[This is a test, this is only a test.](https://youtu.be/UqatLG9B_TY)”

There needs to be a model of reality–even if imperfect–to steer where we want to go. A much needed ingredient to create anything is to imagine what it is and how we get there. I make a living as a [data engineer](__GHOST_URL__/blog/demystifying-data/), showcase creativity as a [writer](__GHOST_URL__/tag/essay/), and fund experiments as an [investor](__GHOST_URL__/the-internet-as-your-resume/). I publish essays because they are a principle in optimism. The reason for the writing is to gain sufficient knowledge, avoid future failure, and eventually succeed. For what? I have no clue yet.

Idk if that’s the point of this essay, but I digress until I get a better idea.
