Good Evening reader,

Surely it's true that some people–if not all–live in a black iron prison. This prison limits the people in consciousness and freedom. Such prisoners then suffer from delusion, unable to grasp the nature of reality. 

Like black iron prison, the non-player character in a video game does not know their reality is virtual. Prisons and programming are two different forms of control. The original meaning of black iron prison is to describe political tyranny. NPCs are in the tyranny of its computer program.

My friend, I thought about changing the name "NPC Manifesto" to "Black Iron Manifesto." Instead, this letter should explain to you why it remains. There's some value in the name, which will grow as the letters to you progress. Consider this manifesto as a reminder to limit the constraints of authority. A way to do that is by direct criticism of control, while looking for means to escape it.

pura vida,
