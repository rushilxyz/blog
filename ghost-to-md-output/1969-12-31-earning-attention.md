Past few weeks I've noticed problems with paying attention. A habit I want to break––paying attention to myself more than the person I'm listening to. 

Tonight, my parents and sister pointed out I depend a lot on people I feel close to. It's different depending on who the person is. I rely on them a lot, but never contribute. My sister mentions it's the Libra part of me.

Relying on people makes me want to consciously seek their validation. For that I become agreeable to their decisions for us––without giving an input on how I feel. This has made me become emotionally disconnected with people. I don't express much of what I'm feeling. 

I want to be attentive with people I'm close with and extend it to others I'm now. I've realized that everyone external to me is a stranger within 3 seconds of meeting them. I instantly forget their names the moment they say it to me. I noticed this when my friend introduced me to his girlfriend (I asked for her name 3 times within 1 hour of meeting her. Three times in one hour). 

I'm trying to become naturally curious about people. I want to sacrifice my agreeable nature, to earn people's trust by paying attention. To share a surplus of my emotions, to not have deficit moments. Must be the "Libra part of me" talking.

Everything they say goes through a filter in my mind to come off as agreeable. Despite not truly caring. I noticed this when a person I'm close with introduced me to his gf. 

Doing that overtime has made me weak on areas like, not caring enough about people. I

I want to depend less on people, pay attention to them instead, and 

I pay attention to myself more than the person I listen to.
