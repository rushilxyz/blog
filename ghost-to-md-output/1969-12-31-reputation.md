There's a saying in [Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySzEXKUSZw) that goes:

> "When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game but you don't get a win unless you play in the game"––[The Room Where It Happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySzEXKUSZw)

That quote translates to a simple lesson: reputation gives you access to the room where it happens. Having skin in the game means you've played the game and have the scars to prove it. Those without skin in the game have things like "active listening" listed on their resume.

Reputation requires taking needed risk to reap the reward or suffer the consequence. It goes deeper than having 500+ connections on your LinkedIn profile. 

There are [better ways](https://exercism.org/tracks) for someone to prove reputation, rather than list it *themselves* on a piece of paper. 

Resumes will slowly become the taxi medallions of the employment world. There are [better ways](https://1729.com) for someone to prove reputation, rather than list it *themselves* on a piece of paper. 

New graduates have the problem of not having skin in the game.

Sisamnes was a judge who accepted a bribe and gave an unjust verdict. 

Reputation depends on how much skin in the game you have.

**Sisamnes** ([Old Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian): *Čiçamanah*) was a corrupt judge under [Cambyses II of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II_of_Persia). He accepted a bribe and delivered an unjust verdict. As a result, the [king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch) had him arrested and [flayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaying) alive. His skin was then used to cover the seat in which his son would sit in judgment.

That quote translates to a simple lesson: reputation is capital. It gives you a chance to be in the room where it happens. It's nice seeing new graduates building a reputation after completing school. They've figured out that reputation is about social capital, not attention: 

> **“Social capital is, in many ways, a leading indicator of financial capital, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny. Not only is it good investment or business practice, but analyzing social capital dynamics can help to explain all sorts of online behavior that would otherwise seem irrational.”**

Those who haven't figured this out yet probably have "active listening" listed on their resume. They lack skin in the game to include the scars they earned.
