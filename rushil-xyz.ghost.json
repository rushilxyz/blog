It's a fundamental promise blockchains make. In other words, it's a database on steroids.</p><h2 id=\"talkin-about-tokens\">Talkin' About Tokens</h2><p>Ok, so we know what blockchains are. What are cryptocurrencies? \"Cryptocurrencies\", \"crypto protocols\", or \"smart contracts\" will be called \"tokens\" to avoid confusion.<br><br>A protocol is a fancy word for a standard language, which allows people to work on specific problems. Tokens are software protocols (<a href=\"https://www.rushil2cents.com/smart-contracts-will-provide-the-snacks\">smart contracts</a>) that enforce rules on a decentralized network (<a href=\"https://www.rushil2cents.com/blockchain-a-chain-of-blocks\">blockchain</a>). Tokens are to internet applications what blockchains are to web servers. <br><br>First of all, there are thousands of tokens deployed on different blockchains. <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, <a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\">Dogecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">MakerDAO</a>, <a href=\"https://z.cash/\">Zcash</a>, <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>, <a href=\"https://chain.link/\">Chainlink</a>, and <a href=\"https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/ETH/DAI\">1Inch</a>. These are crypto applications that solve specific problems.<br><br>Crypto protocols can provide value in two ways. First as a service like any other company or application:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>: automated market maker</li><li><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Ethereum</a>: general-purpose blockchain</li><li><a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>: borrowing or lending service</li></ul><p><br>Uniswap for example is a crypto exchange (like Coinbase or Binance), but will never IPO because it's not a company. Uniswap's operations are not managed by institutions or employees. It's just a smart contract on the Ethereum network––initially starting with less than <a href=\"https://github.com/Uniswap/old-solidity-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Exchange/UniswapExchange.sol\">300 lines of code</a>. <br><br>Second-way crypto provides value is from the token each protocol is part of (the so-called \"cryptocurrencies\"). <br><br>At the time of writing, Uniswap has a market cap of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=uniswap+market+cap&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">$12 billion</a>.

The element of a token is the cryptography behind it (<em>crypto</em>-currencies). When you buy a token, you're buying a private key. <br></p><h2 id=\"cryptography101\">Cryptography101</h2><p>Cryptography is used to validate the integrity of a message. Private keys unlock the complex algorithms often used to encrypt information.<br><br>Of course, there's more to private keys than just decrypting algorithms. In the cryptoworld, private keys are like a virtual fingerprint that is unique to the person who owns them. This is known as a <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-018\">digital signature</a>.<br><br>Consider this a crash-course on cryptography relating to tokens. Things will be under-simplified––so be aware that it's over-complicated:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://mcusercontent.com/13d6f824588a2db77eb01adbf/images/1152fc50-a07d-f06f-5780-39ce81e19849.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br>Cryptography boils down to public and private keys––used to encrypt and decrypt data. <br><br>A private key is similar to a password. It gives you access to tokens on the blockchain. They also act as an API key to provide the services tokens promise. <br><br>Public keys are also paired with your private keys. These act as your pseudonymous identifier. Rather than share personal data, you'd control what to share through your public key. <br><br>If someone has your public key, they can send you coins. If someone has your private key, they own your coins. Selling your tokens does not mean you're giving away your public and private keys. You're merely transferring coins from your key to the receiver's key.<br><br><strong>My Private And Public Keys:</strong><br><br>Public key to my Ethereum wallet: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rushil2cents/status/1386225694624133120?s=20\">rushil.eth</a>. You can type this into any crypto exchange and send money directly to my crypto wallet. I encourage you to do so :)<br><br>Private key to my Bitcoin wallet:<br></p><blockquote>5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9</blockquote><p><br>Just kidding. If that really was my key, I wouldn't be able to reset it. Anyone who loses their private key, loses their coins. <br><br>Cryptographic keys give access to use token protocols on a blockchain network. Just like passwords giving access to use internet applications on a web server. Rather than providing your data to use a service, you can now control what you share through public and private keys.<br><br>That's a fundamental guarantee that crypto makes: decentralized applications that give users control of their data.</p><h2 id=\"incentives-future\">Incentives = Future</h2><p>Ok. So far we've summed up the importance of blockchains, what tokens are, and how it relates to current networks. Here's how to predict the future: study the incentives. <br><br>The investor, Charlie Munger once said:</p><blockquote><br><em>“I think I've been in the top 5 percent of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it.”</em><br><br><em>“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.”</em></blockquote><p><br>Let's see what the outcome for crypto could be:</p><h2 id=\"incentives-for-blockchains\">Incentives For Blockchains</h2><p>When we can make commitments (finance or otherwise) by cryptography rather than banks, regulators, governments, police, and lawyers; the system is incentivized to go from local and manual to global and automated. <br><br>In the words of Coinbase CTO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/balajis\">Balajis</a>:<br></p><blockquote><em>\"Fortunately, technologists spent the decade building crypto protocols and digital assets that replace the need for bank access entirely. They built them not just on Bitcoin, but on newer blockchains like Ethereum. These protocols and assets are now being used together in an internet-native ecosystem known as decentralized finance (<a href=\"https://defipulse.com/\">defi</a> for short) that is fundamentally fair in a way that Wall Street isn’t. An Indian can use defi protocols without a Bloomberg Terminal. A Nigerian can create defi contracts without paying for American lawyers. And a Filipino can computationally <a href=\"https://ntu-srslab.github.io/smart-contract-publications/\">verify</a> that defi code is fair without trusting American politicians and bankers.\"</em><br></blockquote><p>The adoption of blockchain incentivizes social scalability. Don't take my word for it, ask the citizens and activists of <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/50491/cuba-bitcoin-adoption\">Cuba</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-protests-banking/nigerias-central-bank-freezes-accounts-of-police-brutality-protesters-idINL4N2HT06D\">Nigeria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/belarus-tells-banks-seize-money-raised-help-protesters-lukashenko\">Belarus</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelans-try-to-beat-hyperinflation-with-cryptocurrency-revolution/a-57219083\">Venezuela</a>. These are countries already adopting the censorship-resistance of the Bitcoin blockchain and protecting their human rights while doing it.<br><br>For example, the pandemic caused <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/49487/nigeria-is-emerging-as-a-true-bitcoin-nation\">devaluations</a> in the Nigerian Naira currency. They were forced to use Bitcoin to pay for international transactions. They no longer needed to buy US dollars with Naira to make trades with China. It also gave Nigeria the <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/49487/nigeria-is-emerging-as-a-true-bitcoin-nation\">leverage</a> to no longer pay large fees to money-transfer firms. <br><br>The incentives for blockchains are obvious. It encourages to globally automate, share, and scale. The demand for cryptocurrencies are just now being realized. We're at the crossroads on how it all plays out. Caught between the guarantees that blockchains make today and whether it'll be fulfilled tomorrow. </p><h2 id=\"incentives-for-tokens\">Incentives For Tokens</h2><p>Tokens are the birth of a less than a decade-old business model. Decentralized.<br><br>There are no longer central authorities controlling a network. This changes how we align incentives between developers, contributors, users, and investors.

Grasping these ideas today will\ngive anyone an edge 10 years from now. \n\nThis essay will break down as follows:\n\n * Blockchain: A Database On Steroids\n * Internet Vs. Blockchains\n * Talkin' About Tokens\n * Cryptography101\n * Incentives For Blockchain\n * Incentives For Tokens\n * The Case For Cryptocurrencies\n\nBlockchain: A Database On Steroids\nImagine you're a YouTuber creating cute cooking content\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7BJorQsqlA]. You trust Google enough to\nexchange your information for a YouTube channel. That data safely gets stored in\ntheir database. For Google's eyes only.\n\n\nCurrent cloud architectures are like this. It relies on a single business\nproviding the service. On the other end, are users paying for that service. Few\nquestions come to mind:\n\n * Can the two entities equally use the same service?\n * Can users pull their data and bring it to other applications?\n * Can users confidently trust the company to not modify their data?\n\n\nThe answer to these questions is no. \n\n\n * YouTube does not share its algorithm with its creators. Only YouTube's\n   developers are privy to that information\n * YouTubers cannot transfer subscribers into Twitter followers. Google wouldn't\n   want their customers moving to their competitors\n * If there's a policy violation, YouTube can intervene by kicking creators\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ-oK-f0skw] off their platform\n\nThese are problems that blockchain solves. \n\nInternet Vs. Blockchain\nComparing blockchains to the internet is a helpful way to think about current\nnetworks.\n\nProtocols are rules for a system. The Internet is a combination of open\nprotocols with specific actions like TCP/IP (data transfer), HTTP (client-server\ncommunication), and SMTP (sending emails). \n\nThese open protocols allow people to make money on TikTok and OnlyFans. They're\nincredibly useful. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to send this email (SMTP), you\nwouldn't get it (TCP/IP), and we'd be stuck using the radio for entertainment\n(HTTP). \n\nA side-effect of internet protocols is that they're too complicated to use. To\nsimplify it for people like you and me, the protocols get processed over\napplication layers (like Netflix, Twitter, Google, or Facebook).\n\n\nApplications build an easy user interface for people, but they also capture\nimportant user data in the process. Businesses like Google compile this data to\nunderstand their users better. The results are then used for targeted ads for\nsponsors. \"If it's free, then you're the product\". This is true for other\napplications like Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok.\n\nFrom the app user's point of view, current cloud systems are based on fully\ntrusting company administrators. They control everything that happens on a\nserver from reading, altering, deleting, or blocking any user data at will. To\nmake things worse, a hack in a system can expose a user's banking information\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49159859], home\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/01/10/target-data-breach-spilled-info-on-as-many-as-70-million-customers/?sh=7febc6e6e795] \n address\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/01/10/target-data-breach-spilled-info-on-as-many-as-70-million-customers/?sh=7febc6e6e795]\n, or identity\n[https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack]\n.\n\nThe world of blockchain has changed this:\n\n\nOk. I'll bite, what's a blockchain? As the name suggests, it's a public database\n(chain) made from a sequence of transactions (blocks).\n\n * Blocks = valid transactions\n * Chains = bunch of blocks\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain:\n\n\nUnlike Google, Facebook, or Twitter there's no central server to a blockchain.\nThe data is scattered across multiple computers creating the network instead.\n\nNick\n[http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-computing.html] \n Szabo\n[http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-computing.html] \ndescribes blockchains as a computer in the cloud, shared across many traditional\ncomputers and protected by cryptography and consensus technology:\n\n> \"A block-chain computer, in sharp contrast to a web server, is shared across\nmany such traditional computers controlled by dozens to thousands of people. By\nits very design each computer checks each other's work, and thus a block chain\ncomputer reliably and securely executes our instructions up to the security\nlimits of block chain technology, which is known formally as anonymous and\nprobabilistic\"\n\nBlockchains are just like Monopoly. Imagine playing a game with your pals and\nlanding on Community Chest. The words on the card say that \"you inherit $100\".\n\n\nRather than believe you, other players would read the card for themselves before\nhanding over the cash. \n\nBlockchain protocols work just like this. Every event is monitored through \nproof-of-work [https://www.rushil2cents.com/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake] and \nproof-of-stake [https://www.rushil2cents.com/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake] \nprotocols––creating an unchangeable ledger. It's a new form of authenticating\ninformation and committing to it.\n\nThe internet is open-source, but databases are kept closed to the public.\nBlockchains are the next step after open-source because they provide open data\nas well. \n\nWe now have a reliable way to share information, all while allowing millions of\npeople to access, read, and write from the same data source at any given time.\nIt can't be hacked since there's no central server to attack. The data is\ndecentralized.\n\nBest of all, blockchain users are pseudonymous, require no personal data, and\ndon't need third parties. It's a fundamental promise blockchains make. In other\nwords, it's a database on steroids.\n\nTalkin' About Tokens\nOk, so we know what blockchains are. What are cryptocurrencies?\n\"Cryptocurrencies\", \"crypto protocols\", or \"smart contracts\" will be called\n\"tokens\" to avoid confusion.\n\nA protocol is a fancy word for a standard language, which allows people to work\non specific problems. Tokens are software protocols (smart contracts\n[https://www.rushil2cents.com/smart-contracts-will-provide-the-snacks]) that\nenforce rules on a decentralized network (blockchain\n[https://www.rushil2cents.com/blockchain-a-chain-of-blocks]). Tokens are to\ninternet applications what blockchains are to web servers. \n\nFirst of all, there are thousands of tokens deployed on different blockchains. \nUniswap [https://uniswap.org/], Dogecoin [https://dogecoin.com/], MakerDAO\n[https://makerdao.com/en/], Zcash [https://z.cash/], Compound\n[https://compound.finance/], Chainlink [https://chain.link/], and 1Inch\n[https://app.1inch.io/#/1/swap/ETH/DAI]. These are crypto applications that\nsolve specific problems.\n\nCrypto protocols can provide value in two ways. First as a service like any\nother company or application:\n\n * Uniswap [https://uniswap.org/]: automated market maker\n * Ethereum [https://ethereum.org/en/]: general-purpose blockchain\n * Compound [https://compound.finance/]: borrowing or lending service\n\n\nUniswap for example is a crypto exchange (like Coinbase or Binance), but will\nnever IPO because it's not a company. Uniswap's operations are not managed by\ninstitutions or employees. It's just a smart contract on the Ethereum\nnetwork––initially starting with less than 300 lines of code\n[https://github.com/Uniswap/old-solidity-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Exchange/UniswapExchange.sol]\n. \n\nSecond-way crypto provides value is from the token each protocol is part of (the\nso-called \"cryptocurrencies\"). \n\nAt the time of writing, Uniswap has a market cap of $12 billion\n[https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=uniswap+market+cap&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8]\n. To put that into perspective, one line of Uniswap's source code is worth ~$24\nmillion. Uniswap's token price:\n\n\nAll tokens have a current combined market cap of $1.5 trillion\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/]. Some are priceless, others are worthless, while\nthe rest are scams. What do you get when you buy a token? You get a fun\nafternoon at Chuck E. Cheese!\n\n\nJust kidding. The element of a token is the cryptography behind it (crypto\n-currencies). When you buy a token, you're buying a private key. \n\n\nCryptography101\nCryptography is used to validate the integrity of a message. Private keys unlock\nthe complex algorithms often used to encrypt information.\n\nOf course, there's more to private keys than just decrypting algorithms. In the\ncryptoworld, private keys are like a virtual fingerprint that is unique to the\nperson who owns them. This is known as a digital signature\n[https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-018].\n\nConsider this a crash-course on cryptography relating to tokens. Things will be\nunder-simplified––so be aware that it's over-complicated:\n\n\nCryptography boils down to public and private keys––used to encrypt and decrypt\ndata. \n\nA private key is similar to a password. It gives you access to tokens on the\nblockchain. They also act as an API key to provide the services tokens promise. \n\nPublic keys are also paired with your private keys. These act as your\npseudonymous identifier. Rather than share personal data, you'd control what to\nshare through your public key. \n\nIf someone has your public key, they can send you coins. If someone has your\nprivate key, they own your coins. Selling your tokens does not mean you're\ngiving away your public and private keys. You're merely transferring coins from\nyour key to the receiver's key.\n\nMy Private And Public Keys:\n\nPublic key to my Ethereum wallet: rushil.eth\n[https://twitter.com/rushil2cents/status/1386225694624133120?s=20]. You can type\nthis into any crypto exchange and send money directly to my crypto wallet. I\nencourage you to do so :)\n\nPrivate key to my Bitcoin wallet:\n\n\n> 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9\n\nJust kidding. If that really was my key, I wouldn't be able to reset it. Anyone\nwho loses their private key, loses their coins. \n\nCryptographic keys give access to use token protocols on a blockchain network.\nJust like passwords giving access to use internet applications on a web server.\nRather than providing your data to use a service, you can now control what you\nshare through public and private keys.\n\nThat's a fundamental guarantee that crypto makes: decentralized applications\nthat give users control of their data.\n\nIncentives = Future\nOk. So far we've summed up the importance of blockchains, what tokens are, and\nhow it relates to current networks. Here's how to predict the future: study the\nincentives. \n\nThe investor, Charlie Munger once said:\n\n> \n“I think I've been in the top 5 percent of my age cohort all my life in\nunderstanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it.”\n\n“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.”\n\nLet's see what the outcome for crypto could be:\n\nIncentives For Blockchains\nWhen we can make commitments (finance or otherwise) by cryptography rather than\nbanks, regulators, governments, police, and lawyers; the system is incentivized\nto go from local and manual to global and automated. \n\nIn the words of Coinbase CTO, Balajis [https://twitter.com/balajis]:\n\n\n> \"Fortunately, technologists spent the decade building crypto protocols and\ndigital assets that replace the need for bank access entirely. They built them\nnot just on Bitcoin, but on newer blockchains like Ethereum. These protocols and\nassets are now being used together in an internet-native ecosystem known as\ndecentralized finance (defi [https://defipulse.com/] for short) that is\nfundamentally fair in a way that Wall Street isn’t. An Indian can use defi\nprotocols without a Bloomberg Terminal. A Nigerian can create defi contracts\nwithout paying for American lawyers. And a Filipino can computationally verify\n[https://ntu-srslab.github.io/smart-contract-publications/] that defi code is\nfair without trusting American politicians and bankers.\"\n\nThe adoption of blockchain incentivizes social scalability. Don't take my word\nfor it, ask the citizens and activists of Cuba\n[https://decrypt.co/50491/cuba-bitcoin-adoption], Nigeria\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-protests-banking/nigerias-central-bank-freezes-accounts-of-police-brutality-protesters-idINL4N2HT06D]\n, Belarus\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/belarus-tells-banks-seize-money-raised-help-protesters-lukashenko]\n, or Venezuela\n[https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelans-try-to-beat-hyperinflation-with-cryptocurrency-revolution/a-57219083]\n. These are countries already adopting the censorship-resistance of the Bitcoin\nblockchain and protecting their human rights while doing it.\n\nFor example, the pandemic caused devaluations\n[https://decrypt.co/49487/nigeria-is-emerging-as-a-true-bitcoin-nation] in the\nNigerian Naira currency. They were forced to use Bitcoin to pay for\ninternational transactions. They no longer needed to buy US dollars with Naira\nto make trades with China. It also gave Nigeria the leverage\n[https://decrypt.co/49487/nigeria-is-emerging-as-a-true-bitcoin-nation] to no\nlonger pay large fees to money-transfer firms. \n\nThe incentives for blockchains are obvious. It encourages to globally automate,\nshare, and scale. The demand for cryptocurrencies are just now being realized.\nWe're at the crossroads on how it all plays out. Caught between the guarantees\nthat blockchains make today and whether it'll be fulfilled tomorrow. \n\nIncentives For Tokens\nTokens are the birth of a less than a decade-old business model. Decentralized.\n\nThere are no longer central authorities controlling a network. This changes how\nwe align incentives between developers, contributors, users, and investors.\nConsider the concepts below a crash-course on important crypto elements and\nincentives.\n\nCreators And Network Effects\n\nA network's worth goes up only after more people join it. That's what network\neffects mean and how current business models work. Twitter only became valuable\nafter people started tweeting on the platform. Early user's didn't get Twitter\nstock despite increasing Twitter's network value. Crypto changes this.\n\nUnlike internet protocols, tokens offer a direct way to monetize creators.\nPeople can now get partial ownership of a network like equity in a start-up. In\ncryptoland, you're rewarded to join a network early because you'd receive much\nof the upside. You're encouraged to create and build upon a token's worth, while\nalso increasing your net-worth at the same time.\n\nComposability: Crypto Lego Blocks\n\nTikTok will never share its algorithm with its users. It's too valuable to be\nopen-sourced. On the other hand, tokens are publicly deployed on a blockchain\nfor anyone to audit. \n\nWhen you create in public, people are incentivized to build on top of it. Anyone\nhas the opportunity to understand a protocol's functionality, find bugs, and fix\nthem. Miners and validators can reach consensus on whether the the fix is\nlogical, and if so it can be added to the token. Open code also allows for a\ncool concept called composability. \n\nCrypto-land is Minecraft for code. Tokens can plug into each other like lego\nblocks to build something entirely new. Don't like the UX of a certain protocol?\nNo problem––just build your own using the same code. It's as an open API that\nanyone can build an app for. Composability can grow networks exponentially.\nDevelopers can just plug-and-play code to create countless services. It's a big\nreason why the entire crypto market has compounded to what it is. \n\nNew Business Models\n\n\nCrypto changes how businesses will work in the future. Most manual work like\ntracking transactions will be outsourced to smart contracts. The code will\nmanage commitments, while DAOs will manage the code.\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a community of people who do\nthings that automation cannot: make decisions. Like corporate board members,\nDAOs look to improve a token's value by financing projects or building more\nservices. DAOs publicly make decisions, whereas corporate board members\ntypically remain private. \n\nI believe DAOs will be the next wave on how humans handle business. This idea\nwill need an essay of its own, but I encourage you to fall DAOn the rabbit hole\nby subscribing [https://www.rushil2cents.com/rushil2cents-newsletter].\n\nThe Case For Cryptocurrencies\nTo go back to our earlier question about current networks:\n\n\n * Can the two entities equally use the same services?\n * Can users pull their data out and bring it into other applications?\n * Can users confidently trust the company to not modify their data?\n\nBlockchains and tokens allow this:\n\n * Blockchains have no central control. It's peer-to-peer and anyone can equally\n   contribute to the network\n * Users can transfer data interchangeably between tokens through their public\n   and private keys\n * Central intervention is a non-problem because there's no company to begin\n   with and data is cryptographically secured\n\n\nInvestors can now find value in a network protocol rather than start-ups,\nstocks, bonds, index funds, or 401K's. This was an untapped market just a decade\nago. Tokens, protocols, defi, smart contracts, blockchains, DAOs, NFTs, and\neverything else in crypto are extremely early.\n\nYou'll hear good and bad takes about cryptocurrencies. Whether the upside\noutweighs the risks are your decision. I'm here to learn about the nuances of\nthe crypto market and share what I find with you. Right now it involves\nspeculative trading, but investors must realize that crypto isn't useless.\nTokens, blockchains, and smart contracts will be what the internet was in the\n90s:\n\n\n\nCrypto is about convenience. While it's quite complex now, the future will be\nbuilt around simplicity. You're removing an unneeded step in the system: the\nmiddleman. Reducing these constraints will improve efficiency, convenience, and\nvalue. Once that happens, mainstream adoption will be quick, then sudden.

Payments have now diversified outside of physical cash also making daily transactions go up. A majority of purchases are no longer happening with cash alone. Money today is transferred via “payment rails”, which are infrastructures built to move digital value. For example:</p><p>Digital transactions in the US would likely reference:</p><ul><li>ACH (“Automated Clearing House”)</li><li>Fedwire</li><li>CHIPs (“Clearing House Interbank Payment System”)</li><li>Debit Cards</li><li>Credit Cards</li><li>PayPal</li></ul><p>The payment rails above would link to your bank account to complete the transaction.

NFT's can track who the creator\nand owner of the original content is.\n\nExamples of non-fungible tokens and their markets:\n\n * Cryptopunks [https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks] (10,000 unique\n   collectible characters)\n * Bored Apes [https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home] (10,000 cryptographic art\n   of bored apes)\n * Dapper Labs [https://www.dapperlabs.com] (NBA Top Shot\n   [https://nbatopshot.com] basketball video collectibles)\n * Open Sea [https://opensea.io/assets] (NFT marketplace for all things digital)\n * Rabbithole [https://rabbithole.gg/] (Earning crypto by using decentralized\n   services)\n * Mirror [https://mirror.xyz] (Tools to build crypto-native business models)\n\nBored Apes NFT’sVideo games are a good analogy for both tokens working together:\n\n * Roblox is an online game with its own online currency called ‘Robux\n   [https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux]’ (fungible tokens):\n\nRobux (fungible value used as currency) * Players use Robux to purchase in-game skins\n   [https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Category=3&Subcategory=3], collectibles\n   [https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Category=2&Subcategory=2], and gear\n   [https://www.roblox.com/catalog?Category=5&Gears=0&Subcategory=0] \n   (non-fungible tokens):\n\nRare collectibles (non-fungible value used in markets)The creator economy will\nsoon mimic this format.\n\nFungible tokens and NFT's prove ownership of digital information. The logic of\ntokens give built in property rights to its creator and owner. This will turn\npeople into investors just like how the internet made people creators. That's\nthe creator economy in 2025.\n\nThe Creator Economy\n> “If you can compensate each person for their exact contribution, you don’t need\nto pay everyone the same salary. And if every person gets paid for their\ncontribution, those who are particularly productive or innovative will get paid\nmore than ever. And those who aren’t will no longer have a stable salary” – \nNFTs\nand the Future of Work [https://www.drorpoleg.com/nfts-and-the-future-of-work/]\nThere's a quote from the Hamilton [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrkwgEUXyTU] \nsoundtrack that goes:\n\n> \"My God, In God We Trust. But we never really know what got discussed.\"\nThe fundamental idea behind crypto is the concept of trust. Central systems\ninvolve people trusting the decisions of others––without being in the room where\nit happens. Web 2.0 is built in a way that makes our private lives become a\npublic commodity. The structure of the internet will change this as\ndecentralized applications get built out.\n\nWith the birth of blockchains, we can outsource validation to software. It\ncounters central trust by providing the math and computation needed to run a \ntrust-less system. If this happens, we'll go through a shift similar to the\ninternet era itself:\n\nImagine doing this to watch TikToks…What we need to understand about crypto is\nthat it's new. The use cases are still being figured out and many things are\nstill scams. The functionality for crypto is still too early, inconvenient, and\ndifficult to use––just like the internet once was. As progress is made, we'll\nhave no choice but to adapt. So it wouldn't hurt to start learning about it now.\n\n> A quick thread on what would happen if Web 3 became a thing:\n\n— Rushil (@rushil2cents) July 30, 2021\n[https://twitter.com/rushil2cents/status/1420946961050570755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nThis essay’s purpose was to explain why creating content online will be better\nthan working for a career. The crypto ideas above show us new ways for creators\nto sell small bits of content without any middlemen. More importantly, it gives\ncreators a certain level of control on how their content is used and monetized.\n\nCrypto shows the possibility of one day being able to own, monetize, trade, and\nshare what you create online at economic scale. Build content with thoughts of\nit being digital insurance that you’ll one day get to claim. That’s if the Web\n3.0 experiment ends up succeeding. Until then, produce deliberately with hopes\nof compensation, not attention.\n\nAu revoir,\n\n-rushil\n\n> TLDR: creative work > career

The name: 5 In's Newsletter\n[https://www.rushil2cents.com/newsletters]. As of this week, I've ended this\nstructure. The rest of the very last 5 In's newsletter:\n\nHey Pal, \n\nThis is the 36th and final 5 In's Newsletter.\n\nAs of next week, I'll be brainstorming new topics to write about––without\nfollowing a structure. I've become bored of the repetition and I have a feeling\nyou are too.\n\nThe new series will come with a new name and new ambitions.\n\nUntil now, this has been a really fun side project and I’m grateful to every pal\nwho's subscribed. I set a goal to get 500 subscribers within a year. We're on\n253 now, well on our way:\n\n\nI've realized the newsletter is for me to communicate with smart, curious,\npassionate people around the world every week.\n\nThe 5 In's structure was a crutch to deliver a newsletter without fail. It's now\nbecome too predictable and I prefer the uncertainty of not knowing what to write\nabout. \n\nThat means I’ll be experimenting with new ways of delivering content, starting\nconversations, and engaging with subscriber pals.\n\nWith that change comes a new goal:\n\n> \nI want to grow this to 500 subscribers by the end of April, and I need your help\nto get there.\n\nI get nervous asking people for help. It's why I bury my ask to share these\ne-mails with your pals at the very bottom. Most of you probably never see it.\n\n\nToday, I’m putting it front and center:\n\n> \nIf you enjoy or get value from 5 In's, Please help me get to 500 pals by the end\nof April by doing any of the following\n\n * Forward this e-mail to friends and telling them to subscribe\n   \n * Share on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook with a short note\n   \n * Share within your existing community or group chats\n\nShare\n[http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushil2cents.com%2Frushil2cents-newsletter]\n\nTweet\n[http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Weekly%20newsletters%20for%20investors%20curious%20about%20finance%20and%20technology.%20Subscribe%20here%20if%20you%27re%20a%20curious%20pal.:%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushil2cents.com%2Frushil2cents-newsletter]\n\nShare\n[http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushil2cents.com%2Frushil2cents-newsletter&mini=true&title=Weekly%20newsletters%20for%20investors%20curious%20about%20finance%20and%20technology.%20Subscribe%20here%20if%20you%27re%20a%20curious%20pal.]\n\nPin\n[https://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rushil2cents.com%2Frushil2cents-newsletter]\nShare Link To Other Pals [__GHOST_URL__/rushil2cents-newsletter]\n\nGetting to 500 people shouldn’t be hard. To put it in perspective with 253 of\nyou, we just need to reproduce 0.9763 to get to 500.\n\nMy mission remains to: share ideas with people who share the same curiosity as\nme. Yet, the opportunity has grown much more than that, and I appreciate your\nsupport on this wild ride.

If you’re not familiar with decentralization, try thinking of\nit simply as the ability of a group to function without reliance on a central\nauthority. Banks, governments, and businesses are all examples of centralized\nentities. At the core of decentralization is a push toward individual freedom.\nNot freedom to, but freedom from. The distinction is important.”––NFTs Are\nWorth\nUnderstanding [https://nickwidmer.substack.com/p/nftsareworthunderstanding]\nIf you think today’s internet is absolutely perfect with no need of an upgrade,\nthis is what you sound like:\n\nTheories are created by rearranging, combining, and adding to existing ideas.\nThat’s what makes crypto and the decentralized web so exciting. It combines\nculture with technology to create something new. The versions of the internet so\nfar:\n\n * Web 0: a time before online\n * Web 1: users needed to buy their own servers to connect online—while hosting\n   on their own domain\n * Web 2: visiting hosting platforms like Facebook or Google to distribute our\n   content while using their servers––in exchange for all data involved\n * Web 3: a peer-to-peer network where you don’t rely on centralized servers to\n   hold your data. All content is addressed and verified on a blockchain for\n   every user to own\n\nTo summarize the web 3 experiment: today’s internet is reinventing the wheel\ninto something better:\n\nWeb 2 Problems\nTwo forces that effect how the web 2 model works:\n\n 1. The server problem —To upload files on the internet, you need a server. Most\n    folks don’t have a server so we rely on hosting services like TikTok,\n    YouTube, and Twitter to post online content. These platforms are convenient,\n    but it concentrates user content, data, and demand to just a handful of\n    providers. The centralized infrastructure of the internet is problem #1.\n 2. Host-based addressing model— This relates to how we address content online.\n    If you upload a YouTube video, the URL of that video is tightly bound to\n    YouTube’s platform: youtube.com/your_video. You need a seperate account on\n    Facebook to upload the same video there: facebook.com/your_video. The lack\n    of interoperability between online platforms is problem #2.\n\nWeb 3 Solutions\nWith the use of peer-to-peer networks, open-source code, blockchains, hash\nsignatures, and merkle trees––web 2 problems become solvable:\n\n 1. Blockchains are large data sets, split into smaller chunks, and distributed\n    across a network of peers. The peers then share the responsibility of\n    maintaining the network through consensus. Blockchains solve the central\n    server issue by letting users collectively validate information. There’s no\n    need for a single platform authorizing every transaction.\n 2. Merkle trees are used in blockchains to track and verify data integrity.\n    They prove online content by attaching a unique ID (hash) to the media. This\n    creates tiny interpretations from the large data stored in blockchains. Hash\n    signatures are unique to every file. It serves to address any online content\n    from the time it was published. This dramatically improves web 2’s\n    host-based model.\n\nMerkle trees solve the coordination problems that come with verifying data.\nEverything can be traced back to mathematically prove the authenticity of any\nfile connected to the tree:\n\nBitcoin is an example of this. We’ve never before seen a financial system worth\nbillions — without any centralized governance or authority to support it. No one\nargues the amount of BTC in rotation because it’s proven by merkle trees and\nimmutably displayed on-chain\n[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions].

Most folks don’t have a server so we rely on hosting platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter to post online content. These services are convenient, but it concentrates user content, data, and demand to just a handful of providers. The centralized infrastructure of the internet is problem #1.</li><li><strong>Host-based addressing model </strong>— This relates to how we address content online. If you upload a YouTube video, the URL of that video is tightly bound to YouTube’s platform: <strong><em>youtube.com/your_video. </em></strong>You need a separate Facebook account to upload the same video here: <strong><em>facebook.com/your_video</em></strong>. The lack of interoperability between web platforms is problem #2.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dbsT5zK_t_ZdYJUbnlEcUQ.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h3 id=\"web-3-solutions\">Web 3 Solutions:</h3><p>With the use of peer-to-peer networks, open-source code, blockchains, hash signatures, and merkle trees––web 2 problems become solvable:</p><ol><li><strong>Blockchains</strong> are large data sets, split into smaller chunks, and distributed across a network of peers. Those people then share the responsibility of maintaining the network by <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-the-nakamoto-consensus\">consensus</a>. Blockchains solve the central server issue by letting users collectively validate the information. There’s no need for a single entity authorizing every user transaction.</li><li><strong>Merkle trees</strong> are used in blockchains to trace content back to its original publisher. They prove media authenticity by attaching a hash (unique ID) to each media file. This creates tiny interpretations from the large data stored in blockchains. Hashes are unique to every file so they can address any media anywhere on the internet. Best of all, content is transferrable between applications since it's all addressed on one network. It dramatically improves web 2’s addressing model.</li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rNk9YzmIdsWCN7HAakf0SA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>\b</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“This means that data cannot be corrupted or modified by faulty service providers or malicious parties.

Most of all, it demonstrates new ways of proving competency (without sitting in a lecture room for 4+ years).\n\nThe explanations will break down as follows:\n\n * Social Capital Is Online Reputation\n * The Web 3 Experiment: A Decentralized Internet\n * Onchain = Internet Resumes\n * Earning Crypto Credentials\n * Closing Thoughts\n\nAs you can probably tell from my previous essays, I’ve fallen down the crypto rabbit hole. This essay is no exception.\n\n\nSocial Capital Is Online Reputation\n\n“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a person in possession of little fortune, must be in want of more social capital.” –– Taylor Lorenz\n\nLet’s get one main thing out the way: we live online lives. Real-life is amazing, but there’s a part of us that have internet identities. Especially with online schools, remote work, and social media. The internet today is outdated and incentivizes us to assume reputation rather than justify it. We’ll get to that part later but for now, we need to understand that reputation is capital:\n\n“Social capital is, in many ways, a leading indicator of financial capital, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny. Not only is it good investment or business practice, but analyzing social capital dynamics can help to explain all sorts of online behavior that would otherwise seem irrational.” — Status as a Service (StaaS)\n\nSocial capital is internet reputation. By building an online audience, you become more reputable to people. Social capital is the online reputation that you can leverage into your real-life like:\n\n * Building a photography portfolio\n * Producing travel vlogs\n * Selling ball planters for cancer research\n * Marketing a hand-poured candle business\n * Launching a professional gaming brand\n * Educating people on financial trading\n * Commissioning paintings to people\n\n(check my pals out)\n\nTo define it simply:\n\n * Reputation is justified based on what you do online and in real life\n * Social capital is achieved based on how well you use the internet\n\nWith that in mind, let’s attempt to explain how social capital would work on future versions of the web:\n\n\nThe Web 3 Experiment: A Decentralized Internet\n\n“Web3 is a more intelligent version of the internet, built on the principle of decentralization. If you’re not familiar with decentralization, try thinking of it simply as the ability of a group to function without reliance on a central authority. Banks, governments, and businesses are all examples of centralized entities. At the core of decentralization is a push toward individual freedom. Not freedom to, but freedom from. The distinction is important.”––NFTs Are Worth Understanding\n\nIf you think today’s internet is perfect with no need for an upgrade, this is what you sound like:\n\nInternet versions so far:\n\n * Web 0: no internet, a time before TikTok\n * Web 1: users needing to buy their own servers to connect on the web—while hosting content on their own domains\n * Web 2: relying on hosting platforms like TikTok to provide the servers that distribute our content online––in exchange for our data\n\nThe up-and-coming Internet:\n\n * Web 3: a peer-to-peer network where all content is addressed and verified on a blockchain for every user to own. There’s no reliance on centralized servers to hold your data\n\nTo summarize the web 3 experiment: today’s internet is reinventing the wheel into something better:\n\n\nWeb 2 Problems:\n\nTwo forces that affect how the central web 2 model works:\n\n 1. The server problem — You need a server to upload files on the internet. Most folks don’t have a server so we rely on hosting platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter to post online content. These services are convenient, but it concentrates user content, data, and demand to just a handful of providers. The centralized infrastructure of the internet is problem #1.\n 2. Host-based addressing model — This relates to how we address content online. If you upload a YouTube video, the URL of that video is tightly bound to YouTube’s platform: youtube.com/your_video. You need a separate Facebook account to upload the same video here: facebook.com/your_video. The lack of interoperability between web platforms is problem #2.\n\n\nWeb 3 Solutions:\n\nWith the use of peer-to-peer networks, open-source code, blockchains, hash signatures, and merkle trees––web 2 problems become solvable:\n\n 1. Blockchains are large data sets, split into smaller chunks, and distributed across a network of peers. Those people then share the responsibility of maintaining the network by consensus. Blockchains solve the central server issue by letting users collectively validate the information. There’s no need for a single entity authorizing every user transaction.\n 2. Merkle trees are used in blockchains to trace content back to its original publisher. They prove media authenticity by attaching a hash (unique ID) to each media file. This creates tiny interpretations from the large data stored in blockchains. Hashes are unique to every file so they can address any media anywhere on the internet. Best of all, content is transferrable between applications since it's all addressed on one network. It dramatically improves web 2’s addressing model.\n\n“This means that data cannot be corrupted or modified by faulty service providers or malicious parties. Permanent storage means that you don’t need to rely on [internet platforms] to ensure the longevity or integrity of your content. Most importantly, cryptographically secure and permanent data ensures users can credibly exit a platform if it no longer serves their needs or becomes misaligned.”––Publishing on Mirror is Now Open to All\n\nAny media connected to a merkle tree can be mathematically proven to display the media’s authenticity.\n\nBitcoin is an example of this. We’ve never before seen a financial system worth billions — without any centralized governance or authority to support it. No one argues the amount of BTC in rotation because it’s proven by merkle trees and immutably displayed on-chain. This will apply to social capital on the web. Let’s explore how:\n\n\nOnchain = Internet Resumes\n\n“When we hired our last intern, I asked him to send me his wallet address in advance of the interview. By reviewing what he had done on-chain, I knew that we were probably going to hire him before the interview even started.” —The Future of Work\n\nFirst and foremost, the new internet is built upon a crypto layer. Online data becomes on-chain data — meaning all web 3 content is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. Why is this special?\n\nIn the essay \"Why Web 3 Matters\", main man Chris Dixon describes blockchains as \"special computers that anyone can access but no one owns\". That means all web 3 content published would be owned and operated by users rather than platforms. It changes the incentives to create by letting users earn royalties rather than money. Not only can users earn equity, but they can logically prove social capital through their content:\n\nThe future of education is not homeschooling, bootcamps, or cohort-based courses\n\nIt's proof-of-learning:\n\n- Learning on the job through micro-tasks (applied learning)\n- Resume auto builds as you prove learnings digitally\n- Earn ownership in networks as you learn\n\n— Brian Flynn (hiring in bio) (@Flynnjamm) October 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\nCrypto Wallets Are Passports To Web 3\n\nA wallet has a public and private key that gives access to use blockchain applications. Public and private keys are credentials to your on-chain resumes. For example, this is what keys to your Ethereum wallet would look like:\n\nPublic Key (username):\n\n0x63FaC9201494f0bd17B9892B9fae4d52fe3BD377\n\n\nPrivate Key (password):\n\n8da4ef21b864d2cc526dbdb2a120bd2874c36c9d0a1fb7f8c63d7f7a8b41de8f\n\n\nOnce you conduct any transaction on Ethereum, your public key is captured and displayed on its blockchain. This is what “on-chain” refers to:\n\nAnyone who has your public key can do things like:\n\n * Review your on-chain activity\n * Consume content you’ve published\n * Send crypto directly to your wallet\n * See what investments you’ve made\n * View your NFT collection\n\nOn-chain transactions get triggered every time users interact with the network. Since the activities are public, you can reveal evidence of what you’ve done, and when. That’s what employers look for when hiring potential candidates. Judgment, skills, and participation are all demonstrated through your crypto wallets. It’s like a dynamic resume that upgrades based on how well you use the internet.\n\nwallets are the next social networks.\n\n— 𝚍𝚊𝚛𝚔𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚛.𝚎𝚝𝚑 (@jarroddicker) October 6, 2021\n\n\n\nCrypto-wallets are a passport to web 3 applications. Every time you participate on a platform, your public key gets stamped on a blockchain and tracked by merkle trees. This proves how actively you produce online. Whether it’s through internet consumption, curation, publication, or investing — your web 3 passport will prove your online travels:\n\n\nOnline Vs. Onchain\n\nAs web 3 incrementally improves, we’ll be able to filter on-chain activity into personalized dashboards like LinkedIn. The information would serve as a dynamic resume based on what you consume or produce on the internet. The crazier part? Web 3 is one big internet platform split into web communities that anyone can connect to using their crypto wallets:\n\nThere’s no need for multiple accounts to use any web 3 application. Every user on any platform can have one account that controls their data through their crypto wallet. Your content, data, and audience are fluid between any application you’re connected to. All data encrypted by your public and private keys:\n\n\nSneaky LinkedIn\n\nLet’s say you sign-up for LinkedIn to showcase your online social capital:\n\n * You need a LinkedIn username and password to sign-in\n * Personal details like name, address, education, and recent jobs are required to use the platform\n * LinkedIn users flex their skills by listing it *themselves* on their own profiles\n * Employers either assume people possess those skills or have to run background checks to confirm\n * All information gets privately stored in LinkedIn’s database\n\n\nDown The Crypto Rabbithole\n\nRabbithole is like a web 3 equivalent to LinkedIn, but crypto:\n\n“RabbitHole is on a mission to be the University of the Metaverse. This mission includes onboarding new people into crypto, teaching them how to be crypto-native, credentialing crypto users for their on-chain tasks”\n\nRather than you *yourself* adding skills on a profile, you’d actually have to earn them by performing on-chain quests. Here are some examples of skills you can gain on Rabbithole:\n\n * Verifying your on-chain identity by registering an Ethereum Name Service\n * Using a decentralized exchange like Uniswap to buy and sell crypto\n * Lending your crypto and earning interest on that amount\n\nSince every transaction on Ethereum is recorded on-chain, Rabbithole tracks the wallet of users who complete the tasks. Those people are then kept in a verified list and paid through a joint multi-sig wallet. Every transaction is mathematically proven and taken care of by merkle trees and smart contracts.\n\n1. Connect wallet to @freeCodeCamp\n2. Complete low-levels tasks and contribute to DAOs\n3. Progress is saved on-chain as you complete tasks\n4. Platforms like @Codecademy can read your progress when you connect your wallet\n5. UI tailored to your experience, no need to start from 0\n\n— Brian Flynn (hiring in bio) (@Flynnjamm) October 3, 2021\n\n\n\nThis is what showcasing your on-chain reputation on Rabbithole is like:\n\n * You need a crypto wallet to connect to the app\n * No personal details are required, it’s all taken care of through your wallet’s public address\n * Rabbithole users flex their skills by participating on-chain and recording the transactions on their wallet\n * Employers can view people’s public addresses and be assured that the skills were earned, not stated\n * All information gets split up and stored on-chain based on your public and private keys\n\nA difference between reputation on web 2 and web 3: Social capital on-chain would be justified, not assumed.\n\n\nEarning Crypto Credentials\n\n\"I am not saying NFTs are the next big thing. I am saying that consumer experiences built on a crypto stack are the next big thing. I am saying that NFT experiences are showing the way. They are the left tackle that you can run behind into the opening. Where enormous opportunity exists.\"––Fred Wilson\n\nA Non-Fungible Token (NFT) uniquely identifies online content through blockchains and merkle trees. Any media can be NFTs if they have a token ID embedded into the file. The IDs get stored on a blockchain to verifiably prove who the file’s creators and owners are.\n\nPictures speak a thousand words, so here’s a JPEG explaining NFTs:\n\nNFTs in a nutshell:\n\n * The JPEG above is worth $0 in web 2\n * It’s a copy of the original and has no token ID on a blockchain\n * That same JPEG in web 3 is an NFT valued at 74 eth ($293,053.32)\n * That’s $300 thousand…for a JPEG file explaining NFTs\n * If you think 300K is a lot of money to be wasting on digital images, here’s a rock that sold for $2.2 million:\n\nThe jpegs are worth that much because someone is willing to pay for them. The point is: NFTs offer a way to prove who owns online content. Public keys from the owner’s crypto wallet are stored on a blockchain as proof of ownership. There are no disputes on who owns what NFT because it’s logically proven by merkle trees.\n\nIn the crypto world, media can be rewarded as a form of social capital. NFTs can be encrypted as a qualification like degrees, diplomas, certificates, or badges to participants. As more applications scale to use NFTs, people may earn a reputation like online bounty hunters, based on their on-chain activities:\n\nThe best part? NFTs are traced by merkle trees to move between platforms based on their token address. Content can be transferrable unlike web 2 applications like LinkedIn. Rather than a single entity verifying your qualifications, you’d have built-in logic through crypto credentials. Web 3 communities that are already doing this:\n\n * Rabbithole — anyone new to crypto can earn tokens while learning how to do on-chain transactions\n * 1729 — a newsletter that pays eth and btc for completing bounties on crypto tasks and tutorials\n * Mirror — a decentralized writing platform that provides crypto tools to writers, artists, developers, investors, and DAOs (next essay)\n * Axie Infinity — a Pokémon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay\n * Nouns DAO — owning a Noun NFT gives you access to an investment community that controls an 8500 eth treasury ($30 million)\n * Cryptopunks — owning a cryptopunk NFT can prove two things: 1) you got into crypto early or 2) you’re rich.\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nI understand the pressures that come with building social and financial capital. University graduates are the ones who have it the hardest. After spending 4+ years to prove competency in a field of study, they’re barely able to find meaningful work to pay the bills.\n\nThis essay's purpose was to demonstrate up-and-coming ways to earn and showcase your skills. With the scaling of blockchains, merkle trees, NFTs, and on-chain analytics, we now know that:\n\n * People can display proof of reputation based on how well they use the internet\n * Skills can logically be measured through crypto wallets, public, and private keys tracked on-chain\n * Creative work will progress as verification and authentication are automated\n\nWhen I wrote my first web 3 essay about the creator economy, I said:\n\n“The functionality for crypto is still too early, inconvenient, and difficult to use — just like the internet once was. As progress is made, we’ll have no choice but to adapt. So it wouldn’t hurt to start learning about it now.”––The Creator Economy: Today Vs. 2025\n\n@naval made me a clubhouse speaker while I was taking a shit.\n\nI asked where he sees web 3 heading (thread) pic.twitter.com/s144uQKtfg\n\n— rushil (@rushil2cents) October 11, 2021\n\n\n\nIt’s still way too early and nothing has fully developed to a point of mainstream adoption. If you’ve read up to this point, consider this as an optimistic fortune: build social capital as quickly as you can. A good way to start is by learning about blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, web3, NFTs, DAOs, defi, and the creator economy.\n\npaciencia fe,\n\n-rushil\n\nOther essays to get you started:\n\n * Crypto for People Who Don’t Follow Crypto\n * Designing Internet-Native Economies: A Guide to Crypto Tokens\n * Status Monkeys\n * Today’s Web3 Communities: The McMansions of the Internet\n * Crypto, Culture, & Society\n * Web3: in a nutshell\n * What is Web3?

Law administrators were appointed and elected by citizens for laws to pass. As the state’s circumstances went through changes, its constitution changed very little. What did change were the laws that restricted actions of Roman citizens. This gradually made the state’s people more corrupt, feeding into elected officials. Flaws of Rome’s corrupt system came from appointing administrators who ran for power, not virtue:</p><blockquote>“For then it was not the most virtuous but the most powerful who stood for election, and the weak, even if virtuous, were too frightened to run for office.”––<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Machiavelli:+Selected+Political+Writings&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Machiavelli</a></blockquote><p>After they conquered countries in Africa and Asia, the Roman empire believed that they’d never fall. Each passing day gave more confidence to that statement. This sense of security made people elect leaders based on popularity rather than competence. As a result, their central political experiment failed. This could’ve been prevented had the constitution been criticized enough to seek out new solutions.</p><p>Yes reader, I hope you’re not the jolly fellow who fails to see the need for experiments. By criticizing knowledge, we find flaws in it. Experiments find fixes to such flaws, which bring in new ideas. We need variations of such guesses and experiments for knowledge to evolve. As you read my words and contradict or question them, understand the profoundness regardless of it being true or not:</p><blockquote>\"The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth\"—<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Niels+Bohr&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Bohr</a></blockquote><h2 id=\"sticking-to-the-status-quo\">Sticking To The Status Quo</h2><p>Authorities who justify existing ideas often resemble popular high-schoolers banging on tables and singing:</p><blockquote>“No. No. No. <br>Stick to the stuff you know, <br>If you wanna be cool follow one simple rule, <br>Don’t mess with the flow, no-no. <br>Stick to the status quo!”</blockquote><p>Justified knowledge is the product of knowledge not criticized enough to understand its limitations. It has the power to shut down experiments to prevent further change from happening. Suppressing criticism protects the status quo from change. This blurs the lines between what’s fair and unfair.</p><h3 id=\"the-status-quo-on-finance\"><strong>The Status Quo On Finance</strong></h3><p>Of roughly 750 currencies that have existed since 1700, only about 20% remain, and all of them have devalued. The dollar, along with other state-held currencies today face similar <a href=\"https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/\">problems</a>. Meanwhile, people who use such currencies have no choice but to trust the state’s valuation in them.</p><p>Experiments and authorities don’t mix because the search for truth becomes a search for endorsement. The U.S. dollar became the world reserve currency as it pegged itself to gold. In <a href=\"https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/\">1971</a>, excessive spending by the federal reserve made the dollar claims on gold more than the actual amount of gold available. Through America's authority, the dollar’s link to gold broke away. This decision gave birth to “fiat currency”, meaning “formal authorization”:</p><blockquote>“We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.” —<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html\">Friedrich Hayek</a></blockquote><p>Fiat became the standard for monetary knowledge today. It’s based on people trusting the money supply on the state’s promise to not inflate it. This solution is sustainable as long as inflation is under control, which hasn’t been too promising. For years, the federal reserve have authorized monetary policy while claiming power to regulate financial experiments. Central banking structures will continue to justify the status quo on finance until suitable knowledge comes along to change it:</p><blockquote>“The U.S. set the rules of the game through their control of the international financial institutions – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for short-term lending to sovereigns and the World Bank for long-term development finance. The U.S. maintained an open capital account and allowed their securities markets to become a global piggy bank for savers worldwide…We need foreigners to buy our debt, so the government can finance its structurally high levels of spending. But we increasingly seek to impose moral conditions on who can hold that debt.”––<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/09/americas-quiet-default/\">America’s Quiet Default</a></blockquote><p>For all we know, government intervention––like printing dollars from thin air to repurchase debts––may eventually suffocate the fish:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*j0V4NCrcqUejo2tJj_Admw.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*j0V4NCrcqUejo2tJj_Admw.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Don’t get mad dear reader, this does not invalidate you by saying authority is bad and there must be defiance to evolve. I mean to demonstrate that knowledge justified by authority––rather than supporting evidence––should not be considered the furthest truth we have. While authority may stop competition to gain power, criticism of ideas are necessary. We must experiment to test true limits of the status quo, even if it means failure.</p><h2 id=\"decentralized-knowledge\">Decentralized Knowledge</h2><p>Decentralization happens when no single owner can alter the rules of its network.</p><p>Traditional computing lets companies own the distribution of online content within their platform. They own the hardware, which lets them control the software within it. Yes reader, I understand these companies make it easy for people to publish content online to be shared with others. I mean to remind you that for-profit companies have incentives that are different from their users.</p><p>The popularity of TikTok involves making it easy for people to remix anyone's content on the app. It's dead simple to grab any element from a TikTok and create something new with it. The problem is that such content is centrally controlled by its platform. Those who own the hardware control the rules of its software. Does TikTok let you convert your following to YouTube subscribers? That’s against TikTok’s status quo. This resembles power central banks have with monetary policy. Whether it’s data or money, central owners can impose certain restrictions to the actions of its users:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"https://www.rushil2cents.com/content/images/2022/05/image.png\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Fundamentally, blockchains are a solution to an old <a href=\"https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/\">computer science problem</a> that gives people knowledge to run a censorship-resistant system.

It creates a digital space without authority to justify status quo:</p><blockquote>“Anyway, from this vantage point, many of the ideas on how to organize human society have been around forever, but technologies make them feasible and infeasible by turns.

You’re not wrong but it's an experiment worth demonstrating nonetheless.

This is an essay on knowledge, experiments, authority, and decentralization. It will remain to be my first experiment in the \"third era of the internet.\" As my fellow reader, you will be the first to witness such experiments unfold. Enjoy:\n\nIs knowledge the truth?\nWhat assurance do you have?\nIf not for guessing.\n\nEverything mentioned in this essay is true. Not to you but to me. Truthfully, this is my best guess at explaining how knowledge evolves. As a reader, you will comprehend these words according to what’s true to you. When you read something false, you’ll test that idea until it’s proven wrong or right. This mismatch of opinions unfold what’s true, rather than me having to justify it:\n\nSurely, this essay has entertained you so far. It will continue to do so as we unfold into the following:\n\n * Evolving From Experiments\n * Sticking To The Status Quo\n * Decentralized Knowledge\n * Guesses For The Future\n\n\nEvolving From Experiments\n\nKnowledge is a variation of guesses, made true or false by criticism and experiments.\n\nThe internet — a collection of open-sourced protocols — has become the foundation for the knowledge we’ve built. It took decades of experiments to get here. When does it stop? Never. Experiments are necessary for knowledge to be criticized, errors corrected, and solutions selected. Unfolding new knowledge becomes a flywheel for new experiments:\n\n“Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale.”—Marc Andreessen\n\nJustified knowledge happens when existing ideas aren’t criticized enough to be disproved. This slows down experiments from happening, new solutions from unfolding, and better options to be pursued. Societies fail because of their inability to correct problems when realized. If civilizations can’t fix fragile ideas quick enough, catastrophes would eventually cause them to fail.\n\n\nRome Could Be Destroyed In A Day\n\nThe Roman Empire was a powerful civilization that had problems with corruption. Law administrators were appointed and elected by citizens to create and pass legislation. However, as the state’s circumstances went through changes, its constitution changed very little. What did change were the laws that restricted actions of Roman citizens. This gradually made the state’s people more corrupt to find ways around such restrictions. Flaws of Rome’s corrupt system came from appointing administrators who ran for power, not virtue:\n\n“For then it was not the most virtuous but the most powerful who stood for election, and the weak, even if virtuous, were too frightened to run for office.”––Machiavelli\n\nAfter they conquered countries in Africa and Asia, the Roman empire believed that they’d never fall. Each passing day gave more confidence to that statement. This sense of security made people elect leaders based on popularity rather than competence. As a result, their central political experiment failed. This could’ve been prevented had the constitution been criticized enough to seek out new solutions.\n\nYes reader, I hope you’re not the jolly fellow who fails to see the need for experiments. By criticizing knowledge, we find flaws in it. Experiments find fixes to such flaws, which bring in new ideas. We need variations of such guesses and experiments for knowledge to evolve. As you read my words and contradict or question them, understand the profoundness regardless of it being true or not:\n\n\"The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth\"—Bohr\n\n\nSticking To The Status Quo\n\nAuthorities who justify existing ideas often resemble popular high-schoolers banging on tables and singing:\n\n“No. No. No.\nStick to the stuff you know,\nIf you wanna be cool follow one simple rule,\nDon’t mess with the flow, no-no.\nStick to the status quo!”\n\nJustified knowledge is the product of knowledge not criticized enough to understand its limitations. It has the power to shut down experiments to prevent further change from happening. Suppressing criticism protects the status quo from change. This blurs the lines between what’s fair and unfair.\n\n\nThe Status Quo On Finance\n\nOf roughly 750 currencies that have existed since 1700, only about 20% remain, and all of them have devalued. The dollar, along with other state-held currencies today face similar problems. Meanwhile, people who use such currencies have no choice but to trust the state’s valuation in them.\n\nExperiments and authorities don’t mix because the search for truth becomes a search for endorsement. The U.S. dollar became the world reserve currency as it pegged itself to gold. In 1971, excessive spending by the federal reserve made the dollar claims on gold more than the actual amount of gold available. Through America's authority, the dollar’s link to gold broke away. This decision gave birth to “fiat currency”, meaning “formal authorization”:\n\n“We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.” —Friedrich Hayek\n\nFiat became the standard for monetary knowledge today. It’s based on people trusting the money supply on the state’s promise to not inflate it. This solution is sustainable as long as inflation is under control, which hasn’t been too promising. For years, the federal reserve have authorized monetary policy while claiming power to regulate financial experiments. Central banking structures will continue to justify the status quo on finance until suitable knowledge comes along to change it:\n\n“The U.S. set the rules of the game through their control of the international financial institutions – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for short-term lending to sovereigns and the World Bank for long-term development finance. The U.S. maintained an open capital account and allowed their securities markets to become a global piggy bank for savers worldwide…We need foreigners to buy our debt, so the government can finance its structurally high levels of spending. But we increasingly seek to impose moral conditions on who can hold that debt.”––America’s Quiet Default\n\nFor all we know, government intervention––like printing dollars from thin air to repurchase debts––may eventually suffocate the fish:\n\nDon’t get mad dear reader, this does not invalidate you by saying authority is bad and there must be defiance to evolve. I mean to demonstrate that knowledge justified by authority––rather than supporting evidence––should not be considered the furthest truth we have. While authority may stop competition to gain power, criticism of ideas are necessary. We must experiment to test true limits of the status quo, even if it means failure.\n\n\nDecentralized Knowledge\n\nDecentralization happens when no single owner can alter the rules of its network.\n\nTraditional computing lets companies own the distribution of online content within their platform. They own the hardware, which lets them control the software within it. Yes reader, I understand these companies make it easy for people to publish content online to be shared with others. I mean to remind you that for-profit companies have incentives that are different from their users.\n\nThe popularity of TikTok involves making it easy for people to remix anyone's content on the app. It's dead simple to grab any element from a TikTok and create something new with it. The problem is that such content is centrally controlled by its platform. Those who own the hardware control the rules of its software. Does TikTok let you convert your following to YouTube subscribers? That’s against TikTok’s status quo. This resembles power central banks have with monetary policy.

A political ideology that requires total centralized control may seem unstoppable when technology favors this…and then may become untenable when innovation turns things in the direction of decentralization. ”––Balaji Srinivasan\n\nBitcoin is the first blockchain experiment as a response to the economic interventions of central banks.

I transfer data from one place to another and make use of it. At least, that's what I think a data engineer is supposed to do.\n\nThis is to showcase an end-to-end solution using Azure Synapse and PowerBi. It's a project meant to take manufacturing data and help the industry with preventative maintenance.\n\nI have a diagram here to give some context on the process:\n\nWhat we're trying to solve for is to detect anomalies in sensor data to send out alerts and prevent future maintenance troubles from happening. Imagine this:\n\n * IoT sensors (connect directly to the internet) are placed on machines in manufacturing plants\n * They will collect telemetry data like temperature, fan speed, pressure, or vibration sensitivity\n * The data would get streamed and ingested into IoT Hub\n * Azure synapse is where the anomalies would get detected, which also triggers an email alert\n * The transformed data from synapse is also integrated into PowerBi to view the data in a convenient dashboard\n\nNow for the fun part.\n\nI have no sensors for the purpose of this demo, so I have some Visual Studio code to simulate temperature readings. The data is directly streamed into IoT hub. Here's a snippet of the code for the simulated data for those who are curious:\n\n    private static async Task SendAnomalyMessagesAsync()\n    {\n        // Initial telemetry values\n        double minTemperature = 20;\n        var rand = new Random();\n        int i = 0;\n\n        string sensorID = \"S001LM35\";\n        DateTime ingestionTimeStamp = DateTime.Now;\n        double currentTemperature = minTemperature + rand.NextDouble() * 15;\n        string building = \"B-WING\";\n        string buildingType = \"Office\";\n        string city = \"Toronto\";\n        string street = \"8 York Street\";\n        string state = \"Ontario\";\n        string country = \"Canada\";\n\n        int randomSequenceLength = rand.Next(1,10);\n\n        while (i < randomSequenceLength)\n        {\n            currentTemperature = rand.Next(150, 200);\n\n            // Create JSON message\n            string messageBody = JsonSerializer.Serialize(\n            new\n            {\n                deviceId = sensorID,\n                timestamp = ingestionTimeStamp,\n                temperature = currentTemperature,\n                building = building,\n                buildingType = buildingType,\n                city = city,\n                street = street,\n                state = state,\n                country = country,\n\n            });\n            using var message = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(messageBody))\n            {\n                ContentType = \"application/json\",\n                ContentEncoding = \"utf-8\",\n            };\n\n            message.Properties.Add(\"temperatureAlert\", (currentTemperature > 30) ? \"true\" : \"false\");\n\n            // Send the telemetry message\n            await s_deviceClient.SendEventAsync(message);\n            Console.WriteLine($\"{DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime()} > Sending message: {messageBody}\");\n            await Task.Delay(1000);\n            i++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis is what the output of the simulated temperature data sensor looks like. It creates a new reading every second (like an actual sensor typically would):\n\nThere are normal temperature readings ranging between 20-30 degrees. Anomalies are randomly introduced using the code above, which go from 150-200 degrees. The simulated raw data is directly streamed into IoT hub.\n\nThis is what the data looks like:\n\nLet's see what happens to the data when it enters synapse. Azure Data Explorer has a KQL query language similar to SQL that can organize the data being streamed into IoT hub. The anomalies can be detected from the following query:\n\nAs you can see, the query detects the temperature readings above 30 degrees as anomalies.

We know that inflationary periods have begun. What to look for next are the positive and negative incentives that will come into play. Faulty economics is beyond the scope of this essay. My purpose is to explain how downturns unfolding prosperity. If you look hard enough, recessions are rarely a straight line. The rest of this essay will digress.\n\nWhen people want inflation to stop, it typically means that they want disinflationary growth to return. For that to happen, supply-side improvements and greater productivity must increase. Technology for most of civilization, has been disinflationary.\n\n\nPinpointing Prosperity\n\n\"Why cannot we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica on the head of a pin?\"–Richard Feynman\n\nThe chairman of Intel, Gordon Moore wrote an essay in 1959 predicting the miniaturization of electronics in the future. This essay became known as Moore's Law:\n\n“roughly every two years, the number of transistors on microchips will double”\n\nMoore effectively forecasted the rapid rate of computing capability doubling every two years, while also reducing cost. This continued not just for 10, but for 50 years:\n\n * Transistors today have shrunk to less than 100 atoms\n * Billions of transistors can exist per chip\n * There are billions of microchips in existence\n * By order of magnitude, the number of transistors could equal the amount of sand on Earth\n\nThis was what Moore had to say about Intel’s design and product strategy in 1976:\n\n\"We out a product of given complexity into production; we work on refining the process, eliminating the defects. We gradually move the yield to higher and higher levels. Then we design a still more complex product utilizing all of the improvements, and put that into production. The complexity of our product grows exponentially with time.\"\n\nThe birth of the first digital computer is another analogy for complex solutions simplifying over time. The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is considered the first computer that was programmable, electronic, and general purpose. It was built in 1945, weighing 30 tons and being the size of a house:\n\nThe first Apple computer just 30 years later (with vastly more compute power):\n\n\"When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are quite complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don't put in the time or energy to get there.\"––Steve Jobs\n\nAlthough the rate of technology has evolved exponentially, our outlook of the world is quite linear. People intuitively assume the current rate of progress will continue into future periods. That fails to account for the knowledge humanity will have in the future. As a result, elegant systems that are created often get disregarded. Fragile systems continue to be maintained due to incompleteness of knowledge. The state of our current economy is a clear example of this.\n\nTrial-and-error. This is why our evolution became a positive feedback loop. A much-needed ingredient to create anything is to imagine what it is and how we get there. Technology has risen exponentially because of such experiments. The recipe for our prosperity has been innovation, the ingredients of which are elegant solutions to complex problems. While the future is uncertain, we can organize these ideas into the following framework:\n\n * Innovation creates exponential progress until the technology runs out of potential\n * Disruptive technology is often complex in the beginning, but get simple overtime from trial-and-error\n * Once a solution is exhausted, a fundamental change in approach must happen for progress to continue\n * Optimism is necessary for the paradigm shift to take place\n\n\nThe Principle Of Optimism\n\n“Optimists believe that bad things are produced by temporary causes that can be overcomed, while pessimists believe bad things always happen, and if anything good happens it’s temporary.”––Kevin Kelly\n\nThere’s an object in space at this moment coming toward us. Nothing to stop it, except the knowledge that people have built over the years. The odds of an asteroid hitting Earth is one in every 250,000 years. If a rock the size of one kilometre smashed into Earth before the twenty-first century, we wouldn’t exist. Yet we live in a time with the technology to defend against such impacts. An era of historically unprecedented safety. Just look up (even if Hollywood convinces you otherwise):\n\nAccording to the physicist David Deutsch, the principle of optimism is that: “all failures are caused by insufficient knowledge.” I was confused first reading this.\n\n * True optimism is a stance towards future success, while also assuming the failures yet to come\n * Being able to explain failure is how to avoid making them in the future\n * The result of making no mistakes means to succeed\n\nIn other words, an optimist is someone who can explain the failure, not predict success. Bad news is good news on a long enough time scale, but only if you can recognize the failure and fix it. Optimism is being experimental so that we can see what works. In the worst case, mistakes are repeated without questioning what’s not working.\n\n\nThe Future Isn’t Dangerous\n\nRecessions are tough to navigate because it limits the risk people are willing to take. Tough financial times brings out pessimism within people. The extra–often unneeded–precaution makes us avoid everything not known to be safe.\n\nEconomies work in short-term and long-term cycles. People tend to overestimate the impact of new technology in the short-run, but underestimate it in the long-run. By not being experimental and trying things out, we fail to extract information on the other side. This very absence of knowledge is how mistakes are often repeated. Problem-solving becomes static, eventually leading to complacency.\n\nThe financial future is dire, yes, but optimism is the most rational, realistic, and helpful stance to take right now. When we embody the idea that bad things are temporary until a viable solution can be found, the world becomes a cooler place. Of course, this doesn’t mean every problem will be solved, but it moves us one step further at the very least.\n\nTruthfully, writing this essay felt like a waste of time because the points made seem rather obvious in hindsight. On the bright side, there is now a chain of reasoning I can continue to build upon. If you’ve made it this far, consider exchanging emails with me. In return, you’ll receive future letters that will unfold the practicality of what we discussed:\n\nAlas dear reader,\nThe future is prosperous.\nGo further. Thank you.\n\n-rushil\n\nGet optimistic, your future letters await.\n\nstill want to read more?\n\nThe reasonings for this essay came from the following explanations:\n\nThe Law Of Accelerating Returns\nThe Case For Optimism\nRole of Scientific Culture in Modern Society\nThe Beginning Of Infinity\nHow Innovation Works\nInvesting During Stagflation\nThe Pretense of Knowledge\nWhat Bear Markets Look Like\n\n\n","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/10/FfoRwyqVQAYVewd-1.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-10-23T19:37:19.000Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T01:38:32.000Z","published_at":"2022-10-23T20:30:31.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270f7ac02fc610031ea74c6","lexical":null},{"id":"635a053680edfc003d553d0a","uuid":"5f9a78c2-29d7-4923-8656-90d42ddbdb08","title":"The Career Of Art","slug":"the-art-of-career-changes","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Many of you don't know what I do for a living.

Let's counteract that with something practical. Today's letter will be on data architecture. Exciting, I know. I've been building an internal project at work for this past month while traveling. The rest of this letter will be in a case study format to formalize my explanation.\n\n\nThe Backstory\n\nThe purpose of this project is to utilize manufacturing data to help the industry with preventative maintenance. By forecasting failures in manufacturing machinery, supply chains can prevent input problems before they happen. This helps optimize production output by limiting errors. What does that mean? Let's use a fictitious manufacturing business to break it down:\n\nFor this demonstration, let's simplify the infographic:\n\n * Zant Automotive has 2 manufacturing plants\n * Each plant has 3 assembly lines, consisting of 4 machines per assembly line\n * The machines have 4 in-built sensors (e.g. temperature, fan speed, pressure, and vibration)\n * The sensors will collect and store data per second for anomaly detection\n\nBefore the technical talk, this is what anomalies from sensor data would look like:\n\nNow for the fun part, how the backend is built to display said dashboard.\n\n\nSensor Anomaly Detection\n\nKeep in mind, this is simulated. I've written a script in C# to stream simulated sensor data to be stored in a database. This is the output of the code:\n\nThe sensor values in the database look like this:\n\nAs mentioned, we see four sensor values categorized by the plant, assembly, and machine they're placed in. This is still raw data that provides no information. Our purpose is to extract insight from this dataset. Since it comes with a timestamp, we can query the table and detect anomalies within certain periods. I scripted a basic anomaly detection query as an example:\n\n * The query takes sensor values for the past 5 minutes\n * It separates values by specifying which plant, assembly, machine, and sensor to analyze\n * The actual anomaly detection is done through the series_decompose_anomalies function, which autodetects a baseline that captures a repetitive pattern\n * The outliers detected are rendered in a chart, along with normal values\n\nThis is cool, but the process to query the data is manual. How should we go about automating this process to detect sensor anomalies within every manufacturing plant, assembly, and machine?\n\n\nData Pipeline Demo\n\nIn a computing context, a pipeline is a linear sequence of instructions designed to automate software execution. In our case, the anomaly detection query will be configured in a pipeline to analyze every plant, assembly, machine, and sensor value every 5 minutes. Here's the summary of how the data pipeline is set up:\n\nIt's designed to execute the query four times for each sensor within each plant, assembly, and machine. Once an anomaly is detected, new tables are created to form a new dataset to provide better insight. The output for this current pipeline copies data to a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It comes in the form of an alert to inform manufacturing employees an anomaly has been detected. Here's an output as an example of what the alert would look like:\n\nOf course, now that the pipeline can copy insight to a CRM tool, many interesting things can happen:\n\n * New pipelines/processes/flows can be created to alert technicians for inspection\n * Emails can be sent out to necessary stakeholders in the manufacturing plant\n * All historical data can be set into a machine learning model to detect anomalies before they even happen, better yet provide solutions to eliminate them entirely\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe purpose of this demo is to showcase the possible use cases for manufacturing data. Not only can the industry benefit from gathering such insight, but actionable alerting systems can be set up optimize performance.\n\nTo be completely honest, I never saw a market for this when I initially built this project. After my trip to Vietnam, I witnessed hundreds of manufacturing machines that could benefit from similar data pipelines. This project is still in its infancy. The purpose is to demonstrate the potential. There's a market for this type of work and the goal of this case study is breakdown what's possible.\n\nI enjoy the randomness of the letters you receive.

To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans.\"\n\nOpenAI may have achieved the \"interpreting work of art\" stage for AI. We have yet to feed it with obscure enough memes than this:\n\nI see disruption in academia as most obvious because of what the (Large Language Model) LLM is trained with...\"GPT performance on academic and professional exams:\"\n\nNotice the big gaps? Another example of its capability:\n\nEven if GPT4 goes mainstream, legacy institutions will fail to recognize it until it's too late. Certain incentives may cause LLMs to feed itself into every industry. The outcome of this is harder to predict, but let's guess where academia will be:\n\n * Many (definitely some) students will actively use GPT4 as a calculator to pass their courses/assignments/tests\n * University/Colleges will look for ways to regulate LLM usage and mark it as forbidden in most cases\n\nThat's my expectation on how professors and alumni may behave. On the other hand, if academia embraces LLMs early, people will be tested on their abilities to create, as opposed to programmable thought.\n\npura vida,\n-rushil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Fn6HLMvakAAYuuF.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-03-05T20:57:29.000Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T07:34:36.000Z","published_at":"2023-03-15T07:30:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270f7ac02fc610031ea74c6","lexical":null},{"id":"6415383a536e7c003d231e19","uuid":"9ad417bb-e353-4709-8f7c-8c07773f87ca","title":"The npc Manifesto #4","slug":"the-npc-manifesto-4","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://wtfhappenedin1971.com\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Good Evening reader,\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I'm thinking–with chatgpt–of a timeline for monetary policy from \"],[0,[0],1,\"1971\"],[0,[],0,\".

That an all-powerful, mysterious God created the Universe, and decided not to give any proof of his existence?\n\nOr, that He simply doesn't exist at all, and that we created Him, so that we wouldn't have to feel so small and alone?\"\n\nQuestioning the existence of God and aliens is beyond the scope of this essay. However, it's worth critiquing the explanatory powers of Occam's Razor using Popper's criterion for knowledge.\n\nWhen it comes to scientific knowledge, explanations must be hard to vary while still accounting for what it's meant for. The complexity of an explanation is irrelevant, as long as each assumption is true and is testable to be proven false. Simple explanations are more likely to escape refutation because they explain ideas vaguely, to a point where assumptions can hardly fail. Knowledge creation involves a problem that continues with assumptions on how to solve it. When one experiment fails, you move on to the next until a satisfactory answer is found. There must be conflict of ideas for problems to arise and solutions found. Simple explanations are usually true because they provide no means of error correction. In the words of Popper, \"A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is non-scientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice.\"\n\nWhen we combine simple assumptions from Occam's Razor with Popper's scientific criterion, we receive theories that resemble Nick Bostrom's simulation argument. His premise is that as computation matures, humans will be able to simulate the whole universe in computers. Meaning, there's a high probability that all instances of us are already living in virtually simulated worlds. In his paper, Bostrom explains that the simulation argument is not meant to demonstrate that you are in a simulation. Instead, the argument suggests that if it's correct, at least one of the following is true:\n\n\"(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.\"\n\nFew years after Bostrom's paper was published, he published another paper addressing criticsm/praise for the simulation argument. One question he discusses is whether the simulation-hypothesis is untestable. Bostrom mentions that there are observations someone can experience that would prove their world is simulated. He describes a window pop-up as an example, that alerts users: \"YOU ARE LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION. CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION.\" Truthfully, I found this explanation to be supernatural, almost resembling the empirical misconceptions discussed earlier. It's true that if a digital warning appeared in our world, it proves our universe is simulated. However, can the same not be argued that if God appeared before us, it would prove certain religious beliefs? Despite invoking empirical evidence as proof, Bostrom's simulation theory does meet Popper's criterion. The reason for this is because confirming evidence for simulation theory would be the result of a risky prediction, which Popper explains:\n\n\"Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory, (I now speak in such cases of 'corroborating evidence',)\"\n\nThe title for this essay, \"The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance\" was inspired by the film \"Birdman.\" It was the first movie I watched in preparation for writing this (even if I reviewed Contact instead). Truthfully, I never really cared for the meaning of the title. I just thought it was a cool string of words. I can always give adhoc explanations to confirm the title later on. This was before reading Science: Conjectures And Refutations by Karl Popper. The virtue of ignorance isn't about what we know or don't know, but how we can come to know. This is what Popper explains through his \"criterion for scientific status.\"\n\nThe purpose of this essay was to show deep connections between three explanatory sources. I now realize that it's simple to find connections between ideas if we only look for confirmations. Instead of finding confirming evidences between the assigned readings and films, I analyzed the explanations seeking for refutations. After all, knowlede evolves by making bold guesses that are logically sound, but testable in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuttle, Will.

The commands below shows the steps I did to create a username and password.\n\nAssuming you're in a new mac terminal:\n\nssh root@YOUR-IP-ADDRESS\n\n\n\nOnce you've hacked the mainframe of your server, you can do a syspatch to get latest updates, then reboot.\n\nOnce rebooted, I created my user.\n\nOnce my user got created, these commands gave root access to the server from my local mac using the SSH key we created in the last letter:\n\ncp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/yourusername/.ssh/\n    \necho \"permit nopass yourusername\" > /etc/doas.conf\n\nsed -i 's/RootLogin yes/RootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\necho 'PasswordAuthentication no' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nrcctl restart sshd\n\n\n\nI now have access to a server with capabilities for developers.\n\nIt will be like driving a formula 1 car, when all I've known is Toyota.\n\nMy friend, I apologize for the high frequency of letters, but it's fun to capture this in real time as it's happening. Understanding complex systems are worth knowing.\n\npura vida,\n-rushil","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/04/FuqOGWPWABkyM3q-1.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-04-30T01:50:19.000Z","updated_at":"2023-04-30T21:33:07.000Z","published_at":"2023-04-30T04:39:48.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270f7ac02fc610031ea74c6","lexical":null},{"id":"644ea589a502b3003ddfca3d","uuid":"bbe2301a-0cb3-475e-9a83-381cd1cc684b","title":"The NPC Manifesto #17","slug":"the-npc-manifesto-17","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"* ~~npcmanifesto.xyz is already registered as a web domain~~\\n* ~~storage for the domain needs to be created~~\\n* ~~SSH key should be created to have the domain encrypted~~\\n* ~~Private virtual server in the same city as the SSH encrypted storage~~\\n* ~~Attach the storage to the sever~~\\n* ~~Point the domain to the server~~\\n* ~~Configure the SSH into the root IP address of the server (can now remote into the server)~~\\n* ~~Create username to access server~~\\n* ~~Format storage~~\\n* Make sure the server is secured\\n* Nice simple website to host the letters I send to you\\n* Create contacts and host calendars on website\\n* Backups\\n* Receive mail from contacts\\n* Send mail to contacts\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-30-at-1.28.46-PM.png\",\"width\":877,\"height\":1127}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-30-at-4.19.46-PM.png\",\"width\":785,\"height\":511}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"    doas su\\n    disklabel -E sd1\\n    \\n    >>“Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)”\\n    a a\\n    \\n    >>offset: [0]\\n    [enter]\\n    >>size: [83886080]\\n    [enter]\\n    \\n    >>FS type: [4.2BSD]\\n    RAID\\n    \\n    >>sd1>\\n    w\\n    >>sd1>\\n    q\\n    >>No label changes.\\n    bioctl -c C -l sd1a softraid0\\n    \\n    >>\\\"New passphrase:\\\"\\n    [Enter your password]\\n    >>\\\"Re-type passphrase:\\\"\\n    [Enter your password]\\n    \\n    >>“softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd2”\\n    disklabel -E sd2\\n    \\n    >>“Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)”\\n    a a\\n    \\n    >>“offset: [0]”\\n    [enter]\\n    >>size: [83886080]\\n    [enter]\\n    \\n    >>FS type: [4.2BSD]\\n    [enter]\\n    \\n    >>sd1>\\n    w\\n    >>sd1>\\n    q\\n    >>No label changes.\\n    newfs sd2a\\n    >>“/dev/rsd2a: 40959.7MB in 83885536 sectors of 512 bytes”\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"    pkg_add rsync--iconv\\n    exit\\n    mkdir bin\\n    cd bin\\n    echo '#!/bin/sh\\\\ndoas bioctl -c C -l sd1a softraid0\\\\ndoas mount        /dev/sd2a /mnt\\\\nls -l /mnt' > m\\n    echo '#!/bin/sh\\\\ndoas umount /mnt\\\\ndoas bioctl -d sd2\\\\necho \\\"unmounted\\\"' > m-x\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-15/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/blog/the-npc-manifesto-16/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Good Evening reader,\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's been fun to get the private server up and running.
